Experimental Research on Abusive Supervision in Budgetary
Slack Creation","Abusive supervision behavior has long been a problem in the budgeting
process. Its nature has been proven to damage individuals and significantly impact the
corporate environment. Several studies related to Abusive supervision show evidence
that individuals who experience abusive supervision tend to do Budgetary Slack.
Meanwhile, religiosity, which is predicted as a personal value that can control
individuals from committing acts outside the norm or harming the company, sometimes
has little effect. Several studies have shown that high religiosity does not prevent
individuals from taking despicable actions such as earnings management, Budgetary
Slack, commitment escalation, and others. Is there anything wrong with religiosity as
an individual's value? Does this occur due to variable measurement error (instrument)
or method bias in sampling? Researchers tried to compare various instruments related
to religiosity to obtain the most appropriate measurement, especially by photographing
this phenomenon. We surveyed 83 participants using the experimental method with a
2x2 factorial design to understand how religious belief might buffer against the
destructive effects of abusive supervision on budgetary slack. The results of this study

,"Impact of Risk, Commitment, and bonus on completion of difficulty targets: Carbon Emission Case","ABSTRACT
The study  provide empirical evidence about the effect of risk perception on target completion with commitment and bonus as moderating in the case of reducing carbon emissions. This research was conducted because until now there are still many companies that have not yet implemented environmentally friendly production systems. Although there have been many studies that discuss carbon accounting, this research tries to raise from the point of view of management control systems. 
Questions in this matter will be answered by using the theory of rationality which is then combined with the results of previous studies. This study produced three hypotheses which in this case hypothesis testing carried out using the experimental method using 63 undergraduate students as respondents in this study who hypothesized using a two-way ANOVA.  
Statistically all alternative hypotheses are supported. Thus it can be concluded that basically when a person is in a situation that makes someone feel stressed, that person will try to expel his abilities when moderated by high commitments and bonuses.
This test still uses commitment in a fixed situation without looking at the condition of whether someone is a risk taker or risk averse.
The companies should implement a system that is able to increase the commitment of employees, especially managers as project implementers. In addition, the company also pays attention to the amount of bonus that will be given to increase employee motivation.
Situational determinants and information factor that influence people's decisions more. This study examine the effect of situational risk perceptions and information that is each proxy by opportunities and profit-loss on a person's decision to settle due to difficulty by making commitment variables and moderating bonuses

strategis karena berdekatan dengan pusat pemerintahan kota Bandar Lampung. Permasalahan ekonomi
yang melanda tentu saja memerlukan solusi yang tepat salah satunya yaitu dengan pemberdayaan kaum
perempuan melalui kegiatan ekonomi kreatif. Kurangnya keterampilan akan pembuatan produk yang
bernilai jual tentu saja menjadi kendala tersendri bagi kaum wanita untuk dapat berdikari dalam kegiatan

,"Comparison analysis of profitability and leverage of hotel, restaurant and tourism sub�sector companies before and during a covid-19 pandemi","The worldwide economy, particularly Indonesia's, has been negatively impacted by the COVID�19 pandemic. Some of the industries most impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic are those in the 
hotel, restaurant, and tourism industries. This study uses profitability and leverage to examine 
whether there are differences in the profitability and leverage situations before and after the 
COVID-19 epidemic. There are discrepancies between the findings of earlier studies, who found 
no differences between profitability before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. In this research, 
a comparative descriptive methodology and a quantitative technique were applied. From 2018 
through 2022, financial statistics are used in this analysis. Purposive sampling was used to 
collect samples, and 25 companies that match the criteria were found. When data were not 
normally distributed, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed instead of 
the paired sample t-test as the normality test. The study's conclusion demonstrates the 
leverage and profitability of businesses in the travel, dining, and hospitality sectors both before 
and after the COVID-19 epidemic. In the 25 organizations that were analyzed, the results 
revealed a significant value (α) of 5% and a decline in the value of profitability and leverage. 
This indicates that the Indonesian hotel, restaurant, and tourism sub-sector businesses have 
suffered as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study's findings are anticipated to be used 
to investment decision-making. Additionally, this research can be used as information by 
businesses facing profitability and leverage issues before and during the pandemic so that they

AN EXPERIMENT OF INDONESIA’S LOCAL GOVERNMENT","In this era of New Public Management, local governments are required to design performance and financial reports. According to the decision usefulness theory, financial reports and performance reports can ideally be used in decision making on budget allocations. However, the current trend denotes that performance measures are not used for decision making, budget allocation or program monitoring.  On this basis, it is argued that better financial reports would increase the credibility and integrity of public finances and contribute to better management of public resources. This study was conducted using an experimental design between subject factorial design 2x2 to provide empirical evidence for decisions taken by the budget team. The subjects were inputted into 4 cells using different treatments. The results of this study show that there were no differences in the decision on budget allocation by subjects who were informed of the budget realization reports  and financial performance reports (Cell 1), the subjects given the budget realization reports and non-financial performance reports (Cell 2), the subjects which  were given the operational report  and financial performance report (Cell 3), and the subjects which were given the realization operational report and non-financial performance report (Cell 4). These results indicate that the financial reports and performance reports did not have an influence on budget allocation decisions. Furthermore, it implies that the local government budget team needs to be continuously socialized about the importance of this information in order to enable the implementation of budgetary decisions that are efficient and effective.

Several developed countries have introduced legislation to eliminatethe practice, but little is known about how modern slavery is perceived. To build knowledge of this sensitive area, anonymised results from interviews of managers in different parts of the Indonesian coffee supply chain are obtained and thematically analysed. Findings across the supply chain reveal: a lack of understanding of the term modern slavery and misconceptions about the meaning of child, forced and debt bonded labour in a modern slavery context; a general lack of knowledge of national andinternational regulations, standards and guidelines on modern slavery; a broad absence of policy on the issue at the entity level; and a greater concern for economic issues, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. This exploratory research concludes to avoid being overtaken by events in operations and global supply chains continued growth of the industry, both within Indonesia and through exports, awareness raising is a critical first step in overcoming the lack of knowledge revealed.

FEB4,Market reactions to corporate unethical behaviors: A study from Indonesia,"This research examines market reactions to unethical corporate behaviors. An event study was conducted to detect the presence of abnormal returns during the releases of media news regarding unethical practices of Indonesian listed companies in environmental, social and financial aspects. The examples of unfavorable environmental practices are illegal lodging, forest fires, and pollutions, while in social aspects it includes labor strikes and lay-offs, market monopoly, and similar practices. Unethical practices in financial aspect includes frauds and tax evasions. Prior studies from more developed nations have been widely documented in the literature. However, the use of media reports of three different aspects to measure the event is new to the study. The results of prior studies, which mostly come from developed markets, have also been inconclusive. The use of a sample from a developing market is expected to provide distinct contribution to the existing literature.  The results show that Indonesian stock market responded to media news regarding corporate unethical behaviors, particularly in social aspect, as indicated by negative abnormal returns in the third day after the news releases by prominent online newspapers, Kompas. When such information is split into each category, namely: environmental, social, financial information, the result is only consistent for social issues.  Negative abnormal returns occurred on the third day after the media reports of unethical social behaviors of the sample firms. However, we did not find significant market responses to media reports of unfavorable financial and environmental practices by the sample companies. Using paired sample t-tests to examine the market response before and after the event, this study only finds significant difference in cumulative abnormal returns for unfavorable social practices.  In general this study offers an empirical evidence that media reports on CSR issues have information content, especially for firms reported as having problems in maintaining social responsibility.

FEB1,"JOKOWI EFFECT: A STUDY ON THE MARKET REACTION TO THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN INDONESIA","This study aims to provide evidence on how share markets respond to political events, such as presidential election. Specifically, we investigate the so called “Jokowi effect” on the share prices of Indonesia Stock Exchange surrounding the Indonesian  presidential election in 2014. Jokowi is the nickname of the president candidate, Joko Widodo, and Jokowi effect is a term to describe the influence of media popularity of Governor of Jakarta Jokowi on Indonesian politics and economy. In this study, we focus on the changes of share prices and trading volumes of listed firms in the sectors that would presumably be affected by Jokowi’s victory, namely: infrastructure, utilities, transportation, construction and building. A sample of 46 firms listed on Indonesian stock exchange was obtained after excluding firms experiencing corporrate actions, such as take overs and mergers. Employing an event study method, we calculate the abnormal returns and trading volumes surrounding three critical events of the election process: the announcement of Jokowi’s candidacy, the releases of quick-count results, and the verdict by the Constitutional Court. We find that the Indonesian stock market responds positively to Jokowi’s candidacy as well as the release of the Quick Count results. 
However, we do not find such a market response to verdict by the constitutional court. Results of this study supports empirical evidence from the previous studies that political events does have information content. Such findings also support the previous literature suggesting the value relevance of non-accounting information.

,The value relevance of environmental performance: evidence from Indonesia,"Purpose
This paper aims to extend previous developed market-based research on the value relevance of environmental performance by testing the relationship between share prices of Indonesian-listed corporations and their environmental performance ratings.

Design/methodology/approach
The sample consists of 60 listed firms which are rated by the Indonesia Ministry of Environment between 2002 and 2012, resulting in a sample of 246 observations. The Ohlson (1995) model was utilized and modified by including environmental ratings.

Findings
The research finds that superior environmental performance is associated with higher share price, whereas inferior environmental performance is value irrelevant to the market.

Research limitations/implications
Considering the significance of PROPER, this research did not observe other types of corporate environmental performance, such as those released by the press and reported in the company annual reports and websites. These limitations are not controlled for in the tests, and this might confound inferences.

Originality/value
The paper addresses a gap in the literature by providing insight on how a developing capital market values both superior and inferior environmental performance. It also provides implication on the effectiveness of environmental monitoring policy in providing incentives for firms to improve their environmental performance",HF5601,Social Responsibility Journal,2017-09,

,"MENGAPA AKUNTAN TIDAK BERBOHONG? STUDI EKSPERIMEN PADA 
PERILAKU BUDGETARY SLACK","Individual performance evaluation is usually measured based on his success in achieving targets in 
organizations. Thus, budget has major influence on individual behavior in organizations. Organization 
strives to create the most appropriate budgeting system to accommodate the interests of the company, 
department or business unit and individuals within it. This is because budgeting will have an impact on 
individual performance which in turn will also have an impact on company performance. Budgetary slack 
is one of the main problems that often arise in the budgeting process. The gap between the best estimate 
of performance and the proposed budget causes the company to lose out on getting the maximum 
performance potential of individuals and profits for the company. In addition, the social pressure causes 
individuals to behave in a way that deviates from company values. Individuals who experience very 
strong pressure from both superiors and coworkers will increase the individual's chances of committing 
unethical actions (budgetary slack). But on the other hand, several studies show that not all individuals 
are obedient to social pressure from others. Most individuals, especially accountants, refuse to commit 
unethical actions even though the threat of very severe punishment awaits. We are interested in analyzing 
this unique phenomenon. Using the experimental research on 90 participants, we found evidence that 
different levels of individual locus of control can minimize the occurrence of budgetary slack. The results 
of this study are expected to provide consideration for stakeholders in the financial sector to consider 
individual personal values as one of the important variables that play a role in budgeting success in 
companies or organizations.",HF5601,Jurnal Akuntansi dan Pajak,,

In Islamic economics has been regulated on the distribution of business results (net profit) companies to the parties concerned. This distribution has been governed by Islamic laws relating to the issue of ownership, the acquisition of property, the management of property, the development of property, currency, sale and purchase and distribution of wealth also concerning the rights and obligations of parties related to the company. Rules to pay zakat and ban usury has been supported by the system of cooperation on Islamic banking products based on profit sharing pattern that is mudharabah or musyarakah, Law no. 39 of 1999 on the Management of Zakah which allows BAZ / LAZ to cooperate with the banks in the withdrawal of zakat from the customers is very big in encouraging the implementation of zakat. Some sharia banks have registered themselves with LAZ and compared to other BAZ / LAZ, zalcat management by sharia banking seems superior to the availability of adequate supporting facilities and infrastructure, managerial and administrative capabilities of relatively better managers, and the presence of special services for the financing of weak economic communities in the form of al-qard hasan financing from zakat funds managed by sharia banks. Distribution of profit for zakat is paid greater than zakat that should be issued, but there are also banks paying zakat is smaller than that should be due to zakat distribution is not maximal, there are even Islamic banks that do not issue zakat because it is not listed in the financial statements are also not has a report on the distribution of zakat only channeling zakat from an external party of the bank.",HF5601,Jurnal Akuntansi dan Keuangan,2017-01,

technologically sophisticated, which is true regardless of the size of the company. Current technological advances will help companies provide information of a
high standard. Information systems within companies, especially administrative information systems, are progressing rapidly due to the development of new
technologies. Users can access the information they need for a specific purpose or any number of reasons through the use of a system known as an information
system. This system is responsible for the process of data collection, control, and analysis. A system is considered inadequate and of poor quality, if the system
analysis results do not meet expectations. Accounting information systems are beneficial for companies because they facilitate the transmission of financial
information and assist managers and staff with report generation. The primary purpose of the accounting information system itself is to provide information for
planning purposes, as well as to safeguard the information obtained from the existing system, whether it is related to the quality, provision of presentation, or
structure of information, and to ensure that the release is accurate. In addition, accounting information systems are intended to provide information for planning
purposes. Accounting information systems are often crucial for an organization because it is often necessary to correctly communicate an organization's financial
situation to everyone involved in the company. An accounting information system is a vital component to consider when improving business performance.
This system aims to collect, transport, and analyze financial data and other information types to assess an organization's performance based on criteria such as
internal planning and facilitation of commercial transactions. All parties involved in the company benefit from the availability of this information, especially for
the management department's role in issuing calls to action. As information technology advances, businesses use it to expand their operations and can even use it
to support many helpful management functions, such as organizing, directing, and controlling. This trend is expected to continue along with the development of
information technology. There is only one accounting method to ensure that the tasks of the management team can be carried out efficiently, namely by running
the organization's accounting information system very well, for which there is no other choice. Writing decisions by management organizations is a painstaking
process. Because the decisions made as a consequence depend on the information already published, any information that needs to be provided must be correct and
relevant. If the information presented is not accurate or current, then the conclusions drawn by the organization's management are also unreliable. Therefore, we
need a reliable information system and technology to provide timely, relevant, high-quality information. Any accounting information system can be considered of
good quality if it can obtain information that is easy to check and meet information needs in a timely, accurate and reliable manner.",HF5601,International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews,2022-08,

FEB4,"How Managers Use PMS to Induce Behavioural Change in
Enhancing Governance","This study uses the psychology theory to explore how managers use the performance measurement system (PMS) to induce behavioural change in employees in enhancing governance. This study utilizes a semistructured
interview of 14 Indonesian senior bankers. Data were analysed using qualitative analysis software,Nvivo. The
results suggest that PMS improves employees’ task and goal cognition, and intrinsically motivates them
by creating habit, promoting a comfortable working
environment and healthy competition. Employees are also extrinsically motivated as PMS produces rewards and punishments, making employees ashamed of poor performance, including non-financial behavioral aspects
in performance goals. The most significant is how the perceptions of fairness and shame are enacted through multiple PMS uses and processes. This study was 
conducted in the Indonesian context. Therefore, the findings of the study may not be generalized to the banking industries in other countries, especially the Western ones.  These findings will likely have 
significant implications for managers in designing and implementing the PMS to maximize employees’ efforts and performance.",HF5601,International Journal of Economics and Management,2016-12,

The impact of a firm’s strategic performance measurement system (SPMS) on its customer-focused strategy, under varying contexts, has largely been documented in the literature. However, the system’s capacity to positively influence the firm strategy through its impact on the firm’s peculiar internal and external capabilities, in the peculiar context of the developing countries’ financial services sector, has so far skipped a thorough academic enquiry. This study, using Indonesia’ financial services sector as its ‘site’, aims to fill this void in the literature.
