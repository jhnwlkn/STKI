FP1,Analysis of the Effect of Mind Mapping Learning Model on Student Learning Results In Civic Education (PKn) Learning in SMP N 10 Palembang,"Indonesia's national education aims to form smart, participatory and characterless citizens. To realize 
the citizens who have character, then in the national education curriculum system Civic Education subjects are 
applied in the learning process as subjects that aim to shape the nation's character. Developing and realizing 
character citizens through Civic Education learning requires a specific learning strategy or approach that is in 
accordance with the Civic Education paradigm.
The learning process can be successful if there is continuity between teachers and students who are 
actively participating in learning. Continuity of the learning process will have an impact on changing students 
from not knowing to knowing and from not understanding to understanding. Based on preliminary observations 
conducted by researchers, it is known that in the Civic Education learning process for grade VII students of 
SMPN 10 Palembang in the 2018/2019 academic year, there are still many students who are not focused on 
when the teacher explains the student material looks sleepy and tells stories with their peers, if the teacher asks 
most students can’t answer questions from the teacher, and if there is material that is less clear passive students 
do not want to ask the teacher, causing student learning results are less than optimal. This is indicated by the
student learning results that are still low, it seems there are still many students whose learning results have not 
yet reached the Minimum Mastery Criteria (KKM). Benyamin S Bloom (Sudjana, 2010), in his learning theory 
states that there are two main factors that are dominant to learning results, namely the students' internal 
characteristics which include (abilities, interests, previous learning results, and motivation) as well as the 
external characteristics of teaching quality that includes (teachers, learning models and learning facilities). So 
that one way of active and fun learning must be applied by the teacher to make students active and not bored 
following learning in class.
The learning model is an external factor in influencing learning results. The appropriate learning model 
is the Mind Mapping learning model. According to (Buzan, 2007), Mind Mapping is the easiest way to put 
information into the brain and take information out of the brain. Mind Mapping is a creative, effective, and 
literally literate way to map thoughts. This study will discuss the effect of applying the Mind Mapping learning 
model to student learning results in Civic Education VII subjects of SMP Negeri 10 Palembang","L1, LB, LB1501, LB1603",IOSR Journal of Research & Method in Education (IOSR-JRME),2020-04,

Desain penelitian ini adalah quasi-experimental dengan 2x2 desain faktorial. Tiga puluh (30) siswa di setiap kelas dimasukan kedalam salah satu dari empat perlakuan berikut; eksplisit-L1, explisit-L2, implisit-L1, dan implisit-L2. ANOVA dua jalur menunjukan adanya interaksi yang signifikan antara pembelajaran explisit-implisit dengan jenis subtitle yang digunakan dalam video terhadap hasil immediate post-test (p = 0.004 < α = 0.05). Pembelajaran kosakata dengan pendekatan explisit terbukti lebih unggul dibandingkan dengan pembelajaran implisit; dan video dengan subtitle berbahasa Indonesia (L1) terbukti lebih unggul dibanding video dengan subtitle berbahasa Inggris (L2). Hasil ini menunjukan bahwa video yang diberikan subtitle berbahasa Indonesia (L1) dapat menjadi sarana pembelajaran kosakata yang baik terutama ketika dibarengi dengan penggunaan pendekatan eksplisit.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of explicit and implicit vocabulary learning using video with L1 or L2 subtitle to students’ vocabulary mastery of 30 target words. The design is quasi-experimental with 2x2 factorial designs. Thirty (30) students in each classroom were assigned to one of these four conditions; explicit-L1 subtitle, explicit-L2 subtitle; implicit-L1 subtitle, and implicit-L2 subtitle. Two-way factorial ANOVA reveals that there is a statistically significant interaction between explicit-implicit learning and types of subtitled video on the students’ immediate post-test results (p = 0.004 < α = 0.05). Explicit learning was proved to be superior to implicit learning, and L1 subtitle is superior to L2 subtitle in four learning conditions. This result suggests that L1 (Indonesian) subtitled-authentic-video has proved to be a valuable resource to learn new vocabularies in the classroom, especially when presented using explicit instructions.

Thus, to improve teachers’ professionals in the field of teaching, a training of active learning was 
much needed. The results of the training showed that the average score of
their pre
-
test was 59, and 
that of post
-
test was 87 that it can be said that there was an increase after the training. In addition, the  results  of  microteaching  assessment  resulted  in  an  average  score  of  3.47  which  fell  into  good category.  It  means  that  teachers  have  achieved  good  understanding  on  active  learning  and  the capability  to  implement  it.  The  teachers  participating  in  the  training  were  also  satisfied  with  the service  of  the  committee  and  speakers.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  training on  active learning succeeded in achieving the expected goals.","L1, LB, LB1603",Sakai Sembayan,2017,

This analytical strategy combines quantitative and statistical methods to discover trends, assess quality, and track development. A total of 216 documents were chosen from the 403 documents collected. Following 2015, there was a considerable increase in four-year publications. Authors from the United States contributed to 45 papers with 37% citations and ranked first, followed by authors from Japan (31 documents; 15% citations) and Indonesia (31 documents) with rankings citations below the top 10. Most publications were published in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction (12 docs; Q1 Scimago Journal Rank 1.1 (SJR 1.1)). The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines had the most citations (100; Q1 SJR 3.6) and was ranked first in its discipline. The existing core literature on school education on natural disasters demonstrates that this topic is developing rapidly, but with insufficient international research collaboration. Research cooperation in this area must be strengthened to better the global response to natural disaster mitigation, which should begin in schools worldwide. There is a need to widen the scope of study in this field to include natural disaster preparedness education in the school curriculum, assessments, learning media, disaster response education, and instructional designs.

This book is also motivated by the writer's experience of the need to provide English teachers with insights into how to assist Indonesian students learn English successfully. 
Besides revealing that learning strategies affected the language achievement, this study has found that metacognitive strategies proved to be the best predictor of success in learning English. The findings of this study also revealed that motivation was an individual difference that was related with the use of language learning strategies. Since in this investigation it has been shown that low achievers employed strategies that are predictive of success less frequently than high achievers, teachers should provide opportunities for their students to employ self-evaluation and self-correction to enable students to use their metacognitive strategies optimally. Teachers should provide opportunities for their students to be involved in the highest level of mental processes: metacognitive strategies. Students should also have analytical skills in the linguistic forms in order to be able to compare their actual performance and the expected performance in order for the metacognitive strategies to work optimally. This can be done by, to some extent, providing students with formal study grammar for the conscious monitor.  Teachers may also provide opportunities for students to develop more positive attitude and higher motivation since students with more positive attitude and higher motivation can be expected to utilize language learning strategies more frequently

It can be seen from the characteristics of visual representation; each visualization provides different understanding support for the students. Dynamic visual media is more suitable for explaining material related to movement or describing a process, whereas static visual media is appropriately used for non-moving physical phenomena and requires long-term observation.",LB1603,Journal of Physics: Conf.

Alhamdulillah, segala puji bagi Allah Tuhan semesta alam. Puji syukur penulis panjatkan karena masih merasakan nikmat dalam menulis buku. Semoga Allah juga akan memberikan kemanfaatan dari buku ini. Shalawat dan salam semoga tetap tercurahkan kepada junjungan Nabi Muhammad SAW. Semoga kita semua akan mendapatkan syafaat beliau di yaumil mahsyar. Beliaulah hamba yang dikehendaki sebagai pemimpin sekaligus penutup para nabi. 
Buku ini sengaja diperuntukkan bagi para pendidik dibidang biologi khususnya yang membelajarkan materi sistem reproduksi manusia. Sangat dianjurkan juga untuk dibaca para peserta didik yang sudah berada di tingkat menengah atas. Materi yang disajikan sangat berkaitan erat dengan aspek paling pribadi yang dimiliki oleh remaja. Dimulai dari fenomena kehidupan remaja dan permasalahannya, bagaimana sentuhan kurikulum pendidikan dari tingkat dasar dan menengah yang melibatkan materi kesehatan reproduksi di sekolah, perawatan keremajaan dan pengetahuan umum tentang kesehatan reproduksi. 
Besar harapan penulis, agar buku ini banyak memberikan manfaat positif bagi para pembaca khususnya guru. Begitu cepatnya penyebaran informasi melalui media dalam jaringan (daring) menuntut guru untuk selalu memperbarui dan menambah materi dalam menyelenggarakan pembelajaran bagi peserta didik. Disamping itu, beberapa remaja baik laki-laki dan perempuan cenderung lebih merasa nyaman untuk berkonsultasi dengan guru daripada orang tua atau saudaranya. Hal ini merupakan celah positif bagi guru untuk memasukkan pengetahuan-pengetahuan yang positif dan berguna bagi perkembangan mental dan fisik peserta didik. Pemikiran semakin terbuka dan lebih bertanggung jawab terhadap perilaku seksual masing-masing serta pandai dalam memilah informasi yang berguna atau tidak.
