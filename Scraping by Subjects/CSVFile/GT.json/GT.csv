FKIP10,(Similarity Checl): Teacher Learning Behavior During the Covid-19 Pandemic.  Edwina Rusvita Nur; Risma Margaretha Sinaga; Pujiati,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, there were many problems that afflicted the entire community,
especially in the field of education. This happens because the learning process is carried out remotely or
online. Distance learning that is carried out affects the quality of student learning. Teachers must continue
to strive to be able to understand and find out whether the subject matter taught to students has been truly
understood or not. This must be done because teachers are required to be ready to anticipate, face
challenges, and solve problems that occur in the learning process even though online. The purpose of this
study was to determine the learning behavior of social studies teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The research method used was qualitative descriptive with Miles and Huberman data analysis techniques.
Data was collected through interviews, documentation, and observation. The results showed that the
learning behavior of social studies teachers at SMPN 33 Bandarlampung was not optimal in distance learning activities, because teachers were less varied in using teaching materials and learning media, so students were not very active during distance learning and students' social studies learning outcomes were not maximized. There are several efforts that can be made to improve the quality of distance learning by optimizing the asynchronous-synchronous learning model and conducting collaborative learning with
teachers, students, and parents.",GT,,2022-02-12,
