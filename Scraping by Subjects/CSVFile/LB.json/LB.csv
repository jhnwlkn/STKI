FP1,Analysis of the Effect of Mind Mapping Learning Model on Student Learning Results In Civic Education (PKn) Learning in SMP N 10 Palembang,"Indonesia's national education aims to form smart, participatory and characterless citizens. To realize 
the citizens who have character, then in the national education curriculum system Civic Education subjects are 
applied in the learning process as subjects that aim to shape the nation's character. Developing and realizing 
character citizens through Civic Education learning requires a specific learning strategy or approach that is in 
accordance with the Civic Education paradigm.
The learning process can be successful if there is continuity between teachers and students who are 
actively participating in learning. Continuity of the learning process will have an impact on changing students 
from not knowing to knowing and from not understanding to understanding. Based on preliminary observations 
conducted by researchers, it is known that in the Civic Education learning process for grade VII students of 
SMPN 10 Palembang in the 2018/2019 academic year, there are still many students who are not focused on 
when the teacher explains the student material looks sleepy and tells stories with their peers, if the teacher asks 
most students can’t answer questions from the teacher, and if there is material that is less clear passive students 
do not want to ask the teacher, causing student learning results are less than optimal. This is indicated by the
student learning results that are still low, it seems there are still many students whose learning results have not 
yet reached the Minimum Mastery Criteria (KKM). Benyamin S Bloom (Sudjana, 2010), in his learning theory 
states that there are two main factors that are dominant to learning results, namely the students' internal 
characteristics which include (abilities, interests, previous learning results, and motivation) as well as the 
external characteristics of teaching quality that includes (teachers, learning models and learning facilities). So 
that one way of active and fun learning must be applied by the teacher to make students active and not bored 
following learning in class.
The learning model is an external factor in influencing learning results. The appropriate learning model 
is the Mind Mapping learning model. According to (Buzan, 2007), Mind Mapping is the easiest way to put 
information into the brain and take information out of the brain. Mind Mapping is a creative, effective, and 
literally literate way to map thoughts. This study will discuss the effect of applying the Mind Mapping learning 
model to student learning results in Civic Education VII subjects of SMP Negeri 10 Palembang","L1, LB, LB1501, LB1603",IOSR Journal of Research & Method in Education (IOSR-JRME),2020-04,

To test the hypotheses, paired sample t-test and Pearson correlation analysis were applied. The finding of the paired sample t-test revealed that there was a significant reduction in the students’ writing apprehension level after the implementation of WhatsApp in online writing classes. Meanwhile, the correlational analysis was done three times to obtain more specific results; the correlation of the data before the treatment, the correlation of the data after the treatment, and the correlation of gain scores of the data. The results showed respectively that two correlational analyses had a very high correlation and the last one had an average correlation. Furthermore, all findings showed a significant negative correlation; meaning that there was a significant inverse relationship between writing apprehension and writing achievement. This implied that the lower the level of writing apprehension is, the higher the score of writing achievement would be.

The art class was conducted using the Learning Management System (LMS) and attended by 31 Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini (PAUD) students, and arts department. This research method uses a survey derived from two types of data. The first data was obtained from a questionnaire distributed to 211 art students. Factors that determine copy-paste occur because of the tendency to postpone tasks, so they work at the end of time. The following data comes from the discussion assignment report done by the student. Tasks are scanned online using the application. The results of the analysis of plagiarism showed an average of 49.09%, with a word similarity level of 80.77%. Based on online scan reports, the source of plagiarism comes from the university repository. Students use Open Educational Resource (OER) in the form of dictates as material for doing art lecture assignments. In conclusion, students mistakenly understood the use of OER and digital literacy. Digital-based arts learning does not have a significant impact and requires the provision of academic writing.

In the process of improving an athlete's performance, the recovery methods must be optimized. Recovery is required to maximize training and competition performance, fatigue should be minimized by recovering as fast as possible. This study aimed to assess effects of contrast water therapy on blood lactate concentration after high-intensity interval training HIIT) in alte futeal players

Methode. A total of 30 male futsal athletes volunteered to be subjects in this study. The test session consisted of repeated sprints at the distance of 25 m (3 series of two 1-min repetitions at 90% of maximum heart rate). After HIIT, the participants were randomized into 2 groups: 15 received contract water therapy (CWT), and 15 were given slow jogging recovery (SJR). The recovery for the CWT group consisted of periodic immersions in cold water (18°C) for 1 min and then in hot water (37°C) for 2 min, with accumulating 15 min in the water. The recovery for the SJR group included 8 min of slow jogging (6.8 km-h around a field. Results. Affor 30-min recovery, lactate concentration was significantly greater (p=0.001) in the SR group (7.67 mmol/) than

in the GWT group 82 mm and remained significantly different 60 min after recovery (p=0.0001, 680 mmol and 5.01 mmol/l,

respectively).

Without vocabulary, there will be nothing to be conveyed in the sense of form and meaning. Despite its importance, in some EFL countries like Indonesia, the teaching and learning of vocabulary depends mostly on prescribed text books which are less authentic and provide only a few of examples of contextual language use. This study analyses the impact of using English movies to facilitate vocabulary meaning recognition of Indonesian EFL learners. The participants of this study were 26 students of English Department in Universitas Bandar Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia. The participants were given vocabulary pre-test to see their prior vocabulary knowledge. After the pre-test, the participants took part in four-session movie class where they watch ‘The Social Network’, a movie about the invention of Facebook, to acquire and understand the targeted vocabulary items. After three weeks, the participants did another test to assess their understanding towards the vocabulary items. The results of both pre-test and post-test were compared. The findings show that watching English movies help EFL learners to retain vocabulary meaning.

In other words,the process of character formation and habituation is the responsibility of not only students’ parents withinfamily domainbut also formal higher education institutions. With the various problems that  exist  at  higher  education  level,  character  building  for primary  teacher education (henceforth PGSD)students is needed that theyare expected to be able  to  improve  and  apply  their  knowledge,  study,  appreciate  and  apply character values in their daily life behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify PGSD students’character formation and ensure the results of the character formation process in ahigher education institution in Indonesia.","L1, LB",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES,2021-02,

FKIP18,Impact of Geographic Conditions on Sirri Marriage Phenomenon in Situbondo District,"This study aims to determine the impact of the geographical conditions of an area
on the phenomenon of sirri marriage through a qualitative study. Data analysis
was carried out inductively from the results of observations, in-depth interviews
and FGDs. The results of the study indicate that the phenomenon of unregistered
marriage occurs in Sumber Malang, Situbondo, East Java as a result of the
geographical conditions of the area. The topographical conditions of the area in
the form of mountainous areas with an altitude of 500-1,250 meters above sea
level, very steep with a slope of 45%, rocky and dry soils make the Sumber
Malang area difficult to develop economically. This is because agricultural
cultivation is difficult to develop. Furthermore, the accessibility of areas that are
difficult to reach because they are far inland, narrow roads, no public
transportation, far from the center of economic activity have caused people in this
area to choose to stay in their environment. Topography and regional accessibility
have an impact on adolescent marriage behavior in the Sumber Malang
community. Adolescents and parents view unregistered marriage as something
that is done to avoid sin, the certainty of a relationship, economic motives
(because the cost of marriage is considered expensive by the community) and as a
result of the remote location of the area; because the teenager only has a circle of
friends in Sumbermalang. There are two patterns of sirri marriage that occur,
namely teenagers will marry sirri and live together and teenagers will marry sirri
then stay with their parents and still continue their education. The implication of
this research is to provide an illustration that geographical space can affect the
pattern of marriage that occurs in society. Based on this, the relevant government
can provide adequate access to education at the research sites.","HN, HQ, L1, LB",Geosfera Indonesia,2022-04-23,
