FP25,The influence of magnetic field on the growth of tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) infected with Fusarium oxysporum,"Abstract— This Previous research suggests that magnetic field (MF) can enhance seedling vigor, growth, and the production of tomato plants. This study examines the influence of MF on the growth of tomato infected by Fusarium oxysporum, fungal pathogen that causes Fusarium wilt in tomatoes. This factorial study arranged in a stripe split plot design. Factors tested consists of long exposure to the MF, M (control; 7'48 ""; II'42"" and 15'36 ""), how to infect fusarium, F (through soaking the seeds and by infecting fusarium through the stem at the age 28 days after sowing (das), and soaking the seeds, S (soaking and without soaking for 15 minutes before MF treatment). Each unit of experiment was repeated 3 times. Parameters measured were percentage of germination, growth rate based on plant height, and fresh weight. Observations were made on the plant until 42 das. Data were analyzed of variance followed by the least significant difference (LSD) test at α = 1 and 5%. The results showed that the interaction between MF and fusarium (MxF), fusarium and soaking (FxS), and MF, fusarium, and soaking (MxFxS) did not produce a different response on all parameters measured. Differences in response to the treatments derived from the treatment of MF (M), Fusarium (F), and the treatment interaction of the MF x soaking (MxS). The MF (M) and the interaction of MF and soaking (MxS) significantly effect on all parameters measured at each measurement. The treatment of Fusarium (F) significantly effect on germination percentage, and fresh weight at 7 das.

FMIPA2,"Histopathological Observation of The Qurban Goat’s (Capra Aegagrus Hircus) Lung Organs in Tulus Rejo Village, Pekalongan District, East Lampung 2019 Suspected Of Being Infected With Pneumonia","Placement of goats of various ages and the numb  of animals that exceed the maximum limit in one cage can cause the spread of diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, etc. One of them can cause pneumonia. Dirt and extreme temperatures in East Lampung are feared to increase the growth of bacteria that cause pneumonia. The purpose of this research was to determine the type of pneumonia that infects and the
differences between the histopathological organs of the healthy qurban goats and those infected with pneumonia. This research was conducted in October-November 2019 at the Pathology Laboratory of the Veterinary Institute of Lampung. About 13 samples of lung organ of goat qurban (Capra aegagrus hircus) were taken from the Baburahman mosque of Tulus Rejo Village, Pekalongan District, East Lampung. The
results of the study found 6 samples of positive qurban goat lungs infected with pneumonia, with the characteristics of inflammatory cells accompanied by thickening of the septa alveoli, edema, and the presence of hemorrhage. Based on observations, the most infecting types of pneumonia are pulmonary edema and peri-bronchial edema.

FMIPA2,Pengaruh Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis Sebagai Larvasida Vektor Demam Berdarah Dengue (DBD) Terhadap Ikan Guppy (Poecilia reticulata),"Penyakit tular vektor merupakan salah satu masalah kesehatan masyarakat yang utama di Indonesia, diantaranya penyakit Demam Berdarah Dengue (DBD) yang ditularkan oleh Aedes aegypti. Untuk mengurangi efek negatif insektisida, dewasa ini pemberantasan vektor diupayakan dengan penggunaan agen biologi yaitu menggunakan Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) yang lebih ramah lingkungan dan tidak menyebabkan resisten vektor. Selain harus efektif membunuh larva nyamuk, Bti juga harus tidak membahayakan biota perairan lainnya yang sehabitat seperti ikan Guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Oleh karena itu, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh Bti terhadap mortalitas ikan Guppy sebagai organisme non target vektor DBD. Penelitian ini dilakukan di Laboratorium Zoologi, Jurusan Biologi, Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu pengetahuan Alam, Universitas Lampung. Dilaksanakan pada Desember – Februari 2019. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah eksperimental skala laboratoris berupa Rancangan Acak Lengkap (RAL) yaitu konsentrasi Bti sebagai perlakuan dengan empat kali ulangan. Perlakuan yang diuji yaitu kontrol ( tidak diberi Bti), dan pemberian Bti dengan konsentrasi 20 ppm, 40 ppm, 60 ppm, 80 pmm, dan 100 ppm. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan pemberian Bti pada konsentrasi berbeda tidak berpengaruh terhadap kematian ikan Guppy dan tidak berpengaruh secara signifikan terhadap pertumbuhan berat total ikan Guppy.

It is used as a modulation of natural pesticide compound. Alanine is predicted to act as an inhibitor compound in the defense mechanisms in the insect body. This study investigated the modeling structures and the protein receptor from alanine in the immune system mechanism and their optimization of the effectiveness as biopesticides to the insects. This research was conducted using an in silico modeling through the reverse docking stage, including the collection of 3D structures of natural compounds, prediction of target protein, receptor profiling, clarification of the potential of alanine compounds based on mode of action with PyRx 0.8 software, and interaction visualization between alanine compounds with the target protein using PyMOL and LigPlus+ software. The results showed that the alanine compounds from M. jalapa plants have targeted well the glutamate receptors in the insects. Both alanine and glutamate compounds have the same interactions with the glutamate proteins receptor shown by the Van der Waals interaction, e.g. the hydrogen bonding on certain amino acids has binding affinity of -15.889 kJ/mol. The interaction between alanine and glutamate affects the signal transduction cascade at the cellular level due to a neuromuscle and olfactory inhibitor.

One of the bioactive compounds contained in sea cucumber is steroid components that serves as aphrodisiac and sex reversal. In the aquaculture development, one way to increase the production is through the single gender (monosex) cultivation by directing  genital reversal. 
This biotechnology method can be applied using natural or synthetic hormones. The synthetic hormone commonly used is 17α-methyltestosterone. It has a very high rate of success in the male formation up to 100 %, but it leaves residues that are dangerous for human health, environment, and cultivated organisms. A research needs to be done to obtain steroid hormone from the nature which is safe for consumers and environments. One approach is to exploit hormones extracted from the visceral organs of sea cucumbers (Holothuria scabra). Therefore, the aims of the research is to identify the level of  testosterone in hemolymph and male formation of juvenile redclaw crayfish after exposure in the sea cucumber’s steroid extract (SCSE). The research was designed using factorial completely random design, with two variables consists  of SCSE dose variations and immersion time.  Treatment of SCSE in juvenile redclaw crayfish with dipping method, using four-dose treatment of 0, 2, 4 mg/L, one positive control, and dipping time of 18 and 30 h.

alloxan and diosgenin 20%. Group 5 receive alloxan and diosgenin 30%. Group 6 treated with alloxan and taurine. Group 7 treated with alloxan, diosgenin 20% and taurine. Treatments were given intraperitoneally once daily for 14 days. The parameters assessed including blood glucose levels, body and testis weight, spermatogenic cells counts, sperm counts as well as  sperm motility and viablity. The results showed  crude diosgenin extract from
C.speciosus in normal mice lowers the number of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids cells in addition to decrease sperm motility. In alloxan-induced mice, diosgenin ameliorates the blood glucose levels but not
effective in normalization of the testicular parameters of the animals. Taurine, on the contrary, was effective both to cope with the blood parameters and testicular disorders in alloxan-induced mice. Application of diosgenin combined with taurine in alloxan-induced mice, at the end of treatment,
most effective in lowering blood glucose levels compared with other treatment but shows little contribution in normalization testicular parameters. Thus, it can be concluded that crude diosgenin extract from C.speciosus even though combined with taurine has little effect on testicular disorders in alloxan-induced diabetic mice in comparison to the application of taurine alone.",QP,Biomedical & Pharmacology Journal,2017-01,
FP21,"The intracellular photopigment and glutathione (GSH)
dynamics in symbiodinium natural population during light
stress and recovery","It is already proven by scientists, that mass coral bleaching is an early signal for
increasing global temperature. Over the last decades, there was a lack of studies aimed at
photoinhibition in Symbiodinium during laboratory treatments. It was important to predict the
initial adaptation in relation to photo-inhibitory of photosynthesis accompanied by slight photoprotective
mechanisms and gradual recovery of Symbiodinium. This information is important to
understand the recovery mechanism of mass coral bleaching, which can help to develop
sustainable management of the ecosystem. In our manuscript, we applied medium light stress
[600 μmol (photon).m-2.s-1] to trigger changes in intracellular photo-pigments (chlorophyll a,
chlorophyll c, carotenoid) and glutathione (GSH) contents in Symbiodinium. The result
showed that light-induced generated various depletion in chlorophyll (chl) a and chlorophyll
(chl) c contents, and more production in intracellular carotenoid and GSH. The total
intracellular GSH increased during the first 10 min of culture at high light treatment and
followed by a decrease (at 60 min). The GSH recovery finished in Symbiodinium even after 6 h
indicated the high ability of photo-protective processes in the species as another photoinhibition
effect and its photosynthetic performance in the initial environment.","Q1, QH301, QP, SH",,2019-09,
FKIP15,Identification of bioactive compounds from Mirabilis jalapa L. (Caryophyllales : Nyctaginaceae) extracts as biopesticides and their activity against the immune response of Spodoptera litura F. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae),"Biopesticide are biological agents sourced from the natural products to control the pest population. Mirabilis jalapa extract is one of biopesticides that contain the repellence of insects compounds to reduce the Spodoptera litura F. insect pest. This study aims to identify the bioactive compound in the M. jalapa that potentially for the biopesticide and the effect of immune response of S. litura after exposure of M. jalapa extract. This research was conducted using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotemeter (LC-MS) analysis to the identify the bioactive compounds from M. jalapa extract. The measured indicator of the immune response wasthe average of hemocyte and phenoloxidase (PO) enzyme analysis. The results showed that M. jalapa has 30 types of specific compounds. Three of the best compound with abundant composition of M. jalapa more than 6.00% (g/dry weight) were mirabijalone B, vulgxanthin I and miraxanthinI. The compounds were identified as potential rapellents to S. litura. Additionally, concentration of 0.2% M. jalapa extract induce the average of hemocytesof S. litura (P<0.05) as muchas23.98x106 cells/ml. The PO activity occurs after 1h treatment of M. jalapa extract in concentrations of 0.1% (309.00 IU/mg) and 2h in concentration 0.1% (592.33IU/mg), whereas the concentration of 0.8% (w/v)caused decrease in the PO activities. Therefore, M. jalapa has the potential to induce the immune mechanism, their active compound has been potentially used as a biological insecticide.","QK, QL, QP, S1",Journal of Biopesticides,,
