Ironically, this right is deliberately delivered publicly in social media. And Facebook, the largest social media, keep more than 2.2 billion privacies data in the whole world. In early April 2018, one million personal data of Indonesian Facebook users was stolen by other parties. Mark Zuckerberg, as a founder and CEO, acknowledged that the Facebook data consisting of customer personal data had been stolen and used by other parties. This is one of the weaknesses and negligence of Facebook that needs to be addressed in future. Indonesia government issued warning letter to Facebook and required formal explanation concerning those recent cases. However, the Government's seriousness on the protection of personal data of its citizens is still questioned. How Indonesian regulations cover private data protection on their citizen and what steps should be taken to protect personal data in Indonesia? By using International instrument and Indonesia legal instruments on protection of privacy right, this article would give the answer what government Indonesian should do to undertake this situation. The research found that the regulation of privacy protection is sufficient yet the government has no determination to take account seriously on protecting the privacy right and no sanction to the parties were involved. Socialization on the importance of personal data toward Indonesian society in Indonesia should be done, from the basic to the top level.

FH3,Pembangunan Hukum di Daerah. Membangun Legislasi yang Mengayomi,"Apakah makna kemerdekaan bagi kita? Saya sendiri
sangat terinspirasi oleh pernyataan yang disampaikan oleh
Bung Karno pada saat rapat BPUPKI pada tanggal 1 Juni
1945. Bung Karno saat itu menyatakan bahwa kemerdekaan
hanyalah satu fase dalam mewujudkan negara dan bangsa yang
sejahtera. Penting bagi saya mengutip pernyataan lengkap
Bung Karno tersebut sebagai berikut:
Kemerdekaan, politieke onafhkelijkheid, political
independence, tak lain dan tak bukan, ialah satu jembatan, satu
jembatan emas. Saya katakan bahwa di seberangnya jembatan
itulah kita sempurnakan kita punya masyarakat... Di dalam
Indonesia Merdeka itulah kita menyatukan rakyat kita. Di
dalam Indonesia Merdeka kita melatih pemuda kita agar
supaya menjadi kuat, di dalam Indonesia Merdeka kita
menyehatkan rakyat sebaik-baiknya. Inilah maksud saya
dengan perkataan “jembatan”. Di seberang jembatan emas,
inilah baru kita leluasa menyusun masyarakat Indonesia
Merdeka yang gagah, kuat, sehat, kekal dan abadi (Soekarno,
1945)","K1, KD",,2017-08,

state relation. This is creating the new relation between the state and village and open wide possibility for village development. As one of the authority of the village, the authority for the formulation the village regulation maybe the key to open those possibility. Thus, The need for good regulations is very urgent in this new development 
since village regulation is become the foundation of village autonomy. Within the 
analysis above, this research test the possibility of the development through the 
formulation of the village regulation on two village in Lampung namely Way Empulau 
Ulu di West Lampung and Tanjung Setia Village in West Coast. In other side, 
government has enacted many regulations to govern the management of village and has 
made possibility to halt the development of village. This is based on the assumption that more regulation means more barrier for village formulation as Indonesia is using the model of hierarchy of law. This paper found that village regulation formulation success is 
depend on the political will of the people and the collaboration with legal drafter is needed to achieve the goal of village development using the formulation of village regulation.","K1, KD",,2021-06-08,
