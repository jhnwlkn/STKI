FK1,Hubungan antara Mikrobiota dan Psoriasis,"As the largest organ of the human body, the skin
is colonized by a variety  of  microorganisms,  most  of  which  are  harmless  and  have benefits for the host. This microbiota contributes to the metabolism and immunity of the host. The human microbiota includes bacteria, fungi,  iruses  and  archaea,which  inhabit  various  areas  of  the 
body.  Most  of  the  microbiota  resides  in  the  intestine,  only  a  small part   of   which   inhabit   epithelial   surfaces   such   as   the   mouth, airways,  vagina  and  skin.  The  total  number  of  microbiota  on  the surface of the skin is usually in the range 104 to 106 cells per cm2. Psoriasis    is    one    of    the    most    common    immune-mediated inflammatory  skin  diseases.  The  prevalence  of  disease  has  been reported, with a range of 0.09-11.43% by the WHO Global Report 2016. To  date  the  causes  of  this  disease  are  not  fully  understood, 
genetic  and  environmental  interactions  play  an important  role  in disease  progression.  Recently,  immunological  approaches  have helped  to clarify  the  pathophysiology  of  the  disease  significantly. The   skin   microbiota   has   been   shown   to   play   a   role   in   the pathogenesis    of    lichenified    plaque    formation    in psoriasis. Corynebacterium,  Propionibacterium,  Staphylococcus,  and  also Streptococcus  have  been  identified  as  the  main  microbiota.  It  has not been determined whether these changes in the microbiota are a cause or consequence of psoriasis. For this reason, further research on  selective  modulation  of  the  skin  microbiota  is  needed.  This systematic  review  aims  to  elucidate  the  correlation  between  the microbiome  and  pathogenesis  of  psoriasis  and  the  modulation  of the microbiota that could lead to possible therapeutic interventions.

FK1,Mikrobiota Usus dan Osteoartritis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most commonly experienced musculoskeletal diseases. Various studies were conducted to find the relationship between the gut microbiota and the incidence of osteoarthritis. The gut microbiota encourages the production of proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial metabolites which are considered to be part of the pathophysiological mechanisms of osteoarthritis. Various risk factors that trigger osteoarthritis, such as age, gender, diet, and obesity have an influence on the gut microbiota. This suggests the possible involvement of the microbiota in the incidence of osteoarthritis. The increasing prevalence of osteoarthritis calls for an effective disease-modifying therapy strategy to relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the condition. The investigators hypothesized that modulation of the gut microbiota by external approaches might influence the progression of osteoarthritis. To date, some evidence suggests that gut microbiota intervention can be realized through probiotics, prebiotics, exercise, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

Growth optimization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhizopus oligosporus during fermentation to produce tempeh with high Î²-glucan content. Biodiversitas 21: 2667-2673. Saccharomyces cerevisiae grows and produces Î²-glucan during fermentation in tempeh production. The content of Î²-glucan in tempeh is influenced by the growth of S. cerevisiae throughout fermentation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of different types and concentrations of carbon sources on yeast growth, fungi growth, and Î²-glucan content in tempeh inoculated using Rhizopus oligosporus and S. cerevisiae. This study used a Factorial Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with two factors and three replications. The first factor was the types of carbon sources, tapioca and wheat flour; the second factor was the concentrations of carbon source, 0.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5% and 10.0% (w/w). Tempeh produced was investigated for yeast number, fungi number, Î²-glucan content, and pH value. The obtained data were tested using Tukey's Honestly Significance Difference (HSD) test. The results showed that the addition of various types and concentrations of carbon source significantly influenced the increase in yeast number, fungi number, Î²-glucan content, and pH in tempeh. The growth of yeast, fungi, and Î²-glucan content increased along with the increment of carbon source concentration. The amounts of yeast, fungi, and Î²-glucans in tempeh added with tapioca were higher compared to tempeh with wheat flour. The addition of 10% tapioca produced the highest amount of yeast with 9.505 Log CFU/g and the highest Î²-glucan content with 0.707% (w/w).",QR,Biodiversitas Journal of Biological Diversity,2020-06,

FP19,Effect of Spontaneous Lactic Acid Fermentation on Physico-Chemical Properties of Sweet Potato Flour.,"Native sweet potato flour is usually has low whiteness index and has limited application in food system due to its inherent functional properties.  Therefore, it needs modification process to improve this properties.  In this study, sweet potato cubes were fermented spontaneously by lactic acid bacteria for 120h before being processed to flour to modify its properties.  Selected physics-chemical properties of flour were then determined and compared with the control (without fermentation).  The results showed that the lactic acid fermentation significantly caused more changes on the flour properties.  The lactic acid fermentation caused alteration in the starch granules as evident by Scanning Electron Microscopy.  When compared to the control flour, spontaneous fermented flour had lower solubility, higher sweeping power and paste viscosity.  The results suggested lactic spontaneous fermentation within 120h period of time could provide a greater elf flour modification.",QR,Microbiology Indonesia,2014-03-01,

organic compound can be degraded by one fungus or another. An enormous range of organic compounds can be utilized by
fungi, especially the major organic compounds such as cellulose, xylan and lignin. The aim of the research was to provide
fungal inoculum of selected fungi as a Composting Starter Kit (CSK) to increase decomposition process of leaf litter. The
fungi were isolated from decomposing leaf litter and selected based on qualitative measurement of cellulase, xylanase and
ligninase activity. The result showed that there were 5 cellulolytic, 6 xylanolytic, and 2 ligninolytic isolates potentially
used as inocula for leaf litter composting. Based on a halo test indicated that isolates Shj, Lht, and Lpt1 had the highest
ratio for cellulase, xylanase and ligninase activity respectively. Inoculum of those three isolates were developed on
sorghum seeds and were able to produce spores of Shj = 1.5 x 109, Lht = 9.3 x 107 and Lpt1 = 4.2 x 109 spores/ml. The
viability test for inoculum showed the number of colonies of Shj = 9.6 x 109, Lht = 5.6 x 108 and Lpt1 = 8.2 x 106 CFUs. In
conclusion, development of fungal inoculum is possibly prepared using sorghum grains inoculated with selected fungi.
