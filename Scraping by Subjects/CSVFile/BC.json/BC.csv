FP1,Overseas Lahat Community in Bandarlampung,"The Lahat people are one of the people who are very obedient to customs. Adat is something that 
must be adhered to firmly. Even though the Lahat people are far from their hometown, they still maintain 
and also preserve their cultural customs. One of them is the philosophy of Seganti Setungguan. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the implementation of the philosophy of seganti setungguan 
among overseas communities in Bandarlampung. The method used in this research is the descriptive 
qualitative research method. The approach used in this research is ethnography. The research location is 
in the city of Bandarlampung, this location was chosen as a research location because there are Lahat 
people who live and live in Lampung Province. So that researchers can see facts or realities in society that 
have these characteristics. The results showed that the Lahat people who were overseas continued to carry 
out and preserve the philosophy of the Lahat by forming an association of Lahat people. The form of 
implementation of the philosophy as a wavering is carried out in the form of joyful activities such as 
weddings, then mourning activities, such as death and calamities, then educational activities, and religious 
activities. The implementation of this philosophy is as much as a striving, indirectly forming mechanical 
social solidarity that binds fellow Lahat people overseas due to the feeling of coincidence, helping, and 
caring for others.",BC,Overseas Lahat Community in Bandarlampung,2021-06,
