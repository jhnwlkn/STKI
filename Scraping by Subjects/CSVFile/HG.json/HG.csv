FEB6,Form Penilaian Reviewer: Value at Risk and Expected returns portfolio )companies listed on LQ45 index period 2013-2016,"Form Penilaian Reviewer:The objective of this research is to investigate whether there is a positive relationship between Value at Risk and Expected Portfolio Returns on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The population of this research is companies listed on the LQ45 index for the period 2013–2016, and the sample is 20 companies that meet the criteria. Markowitz method was used to form 65 portfolios; each consists of a combination of two stocks that have a negative correlation. The result shows that there is no positive relationship between Value at Risk and Expected Portfolio Returns. On the contrary, the correlation coefficient indicated that there is a negative relationship between the variables, which means that there is an inverse relationship (high return low risk, and vice versa). It proves that the assumption of a rational investor is avoiding risk (risk averse). This result is also supported by the findings from Schroders Global Investment Trends Survey 2015, which shows that 63% of investors in Indonesia prefer to allocate their investments in instruments with low- and medium-risk levels. However, it does not mean that the concept of high-risk high-return is not applicable in Indonesia because the result is not significant.",HG,,2018-11,

FEB4,Effects of Strategic Performance Measurement System and Islamic Work Ethics on Firm Performance: (Evidence from Malaysian Islamic Banks),"The strategic performance measurement system (SPMS) is part of the performance measurement system. SPMS is a performance measurement system that combines strategy, business operations, and finance to measure how well a company achieves its targets/vision and mission. The implementation of a successful strategy in a company should be guided by two important things, first an understanding of the company cycle that connects strategy and operations, and second, knowing what strategies are used in each phase of the company. The performance measurement system encourages managers to think strategically about how the company's activities fit into other parts of the company and to assist the company in managing its operational activities. Inadequate management supervision on the performance measurement system puts the company at risk of failure. A suitable performance measurement system can protect the organization from potential losses and increase organizational effectiveness.
Work ethics is interesting to study because it presumed to be greatly affects company performance. The company's values are influenced by the ethics that the company operates. The company's values are influenced by the ethics that the company operates. Islamic Work Ethics comes from the Qur’an and Hadiths. This study aims to examine the effect of SPMS and Islamic work ethics on company performance and to see the moderating effect of Islamic work ethics on the relationship between SPMS and firm performance and to investigate the moderating effect of Islamic work ethics on the relationship between competitive strategy and company performance (Malaysian Islamic banking). The research design is explanatory research with a quantitative approach using a survey method in the Islamic banking industry. The population of this research is Islamic commercial banks, the sampling technique is based on purposive sampling method, the data used are primary. The research data processing using structural equation modeling. The difference between this study and previous research is that this study uses the Islamic work ethic variable and then investigates the effect of the strategic performance measurement system on company performance in Malaysian Islamic banks.
The results show that there is sufficient evidence that Islamic work ethics has positive effects on firm performance. While the effects of strategic performance measurement system on firm performance shows not supported. The role of moderating effects of Islamic work ethics on the strategic performance measurement system variable against firm performance which is moderated by Islamic work ethics shows supported results and a positive slope. This means that when Islamic work ethics is stronger, the effect of the strategic performance measurement system on firm performance is higher.",HG,Ilkogretim Online,2021,

The measurement of environmental activity was proxied by three environmental activity. They are disclosure of strip- ping costs in the production phase, exploration and evaluation of assets and en- vironmental management on general mining.
There are 41 samples of this research consisting of all mining companies in Indo- nesia that have fulfilled the sample criteria from 2011 until 2013. The data on this research was tested by multiple linear regression. The result of this research showed that the stripping costs in the production phase and environmental man- agement on general mining had significantly positive effects on financial perfor- mance, while exploration and evaluation assets had significantly negative effects on financial performance.
This study shows that the cost to acquire the best technology that companies use when performing exfoliating ground at the beginning of production activity brings a positive performance for the company. Similarly, environmental man- agement implemented in the company also had a positive impact for the survival of the company. These results indicate that the company implemented best act in the management of the environment, increasing the company's performance.

The sample for this research was 232 companies that have fulfilled the sample criteria from
2017-2020 which are sourced from the company database on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.
The research data was tested statistically using multiple regression analysis. The results of this
study proved that the type of industry which was sensitive to the environment will contribute to
an increase of the environmental costs by companies and there was no bias between the
environmental disclosure practices in annual reports and environmental performance of
companies in Indonesia. Other results showed that companies that had bad news related to the
environment tended to allocate less environmental costs because if environmental damage has
occurred, the company's responsibility was not only limited to recovery on environmental
aspects but must resolve the impacts that occur on social and financial aspects","HG, HJ",Uluslararası Akademik Birikim Dergisi,2022-12-31,

Model bisnis ini dirayakan sedemikian rupa sebagai proyeksi ekonomi yang berkeadilan dan sempat mendorong tren istilah ‘ekonomi berbagi’. Namun, mimpi itu hanya isapan jempol.

FEB6,Sharia Compiant Assets Pricing Model in Mudharabah Perspective : Evidence from Indonesia Stock Exchange,"Abstract: Introduction/Main Objectives: The use of risk-free rate instrument in calculating CAPM has been a distinctive problem for the performers of sharia economic because it is considered to be related to usury and violates the principle of profits accompanying risk (al-ghunm bi ghurum) and profit result from work. (al-kharaj bil damam). Therefore, some practitioners arrange the alternative model that do not involve risk-free rate in the calculation, namely Tomkin and Karim who remove all component of interest, Asker who proposes zakat 2,5% as the minimum rate, Dirbali who proposes the alternative use of sukuk returns, Sheikh who applies the alternative growth of GDP, and Hanif who uses inflation as the replacement of interest. The research proposes the arguments about the weakness of each model, as well as developing the other alternative models that could be used as the replacement of risk-free rate in the calculation of Sharia Compliant Asset Pricing Model (SCAPM) model. Novelty: The research proposes the SCAPM Model by applying mudharabah as the alternative of risk-free rate as a novelty. The inexistence of previous researcher who study the same model may be caused by the reason that mudharabah is not a return type that provides income certainty so that it is difficult to be set as a benchmark of risk in calculation. Research Methods: Model used in this research testing is the modification from the regression model of CAPM, with significant testing of mudharabah variable using partial significance test (t-test), while the test for SCAPM model as an alternative to CAPM uses two different mean tests as well as applying the Mann-Whitney test. Finding/Results: The result obtained in this research is mudharabah variable has significant value in SCAPM regression model so that it can be stated that mudharabah variable can be used as a substitute for the risk-free rate in developing the SCAPM model. Meanwhile, related to the difference test between SCAPM and CAPM models, it was found that there was no average difference between SCAPM and CAPM. Therefore, it could be concluded that mudharabah SCAPM model could be used as an alternative model for CAPM replacement model. Conclusion: It can be concluded that SCAPM model with the application of mudharabah variable can be used as the alternative replacement model of CAPM in estimating the return value of the securities.

The research sample uses 31 companies through purposive sampling. The research analysis tool uses SmartPLS 3.0. Based on the results of the analysis, the path coefficient of stock price fluctuations with company value shows that there is an effect of stock price fluctuations on company value. The path coefficient of stock price fluctuations with earnings management shows that there is an effect of stock price fluctuations on earning management. Meanwhile, the coefficient of earning management path with company value, there is no effect of earning management on company value. It also occurs in the path coefficient of earning management as a mediation of stock price fluctuations on company value. The analysis shows that there is no effect of earning management as a mediation of stock price fluctuations on company value. This is supported by the results of testing the third hypothesis which makes earning management as a mediation a negative effect on company value. However, because the results of testing the second hypothesis have an effect on stock price fluctuations on earning management, it can be concluded that earnings management only mediates a small part of stock price fluctuations on company value, although there is no effect of earning management as a mediator.

development of the capital market. To be able to
realize this, it is necessary to make an effort to attract
investors to invest in the Indonesian capital market.
The attractiveness of the capital market among
investors lies in the value of stock liquidity and market
capitalization which are strongly influenced by the
stability of Indonesia's socio-political environment.
This study aims to: 1) Assess the challenges of
investment in the Indonesian capital market; and 2)
Formulating strategies that can be applied to increase
stock liquidity and encourage market capitalization
growth.
The type of this research is descriptive with
qualitative approach. Research data in the form of
stock liquidity value and market capitalization are
obtained from weekly capital market statistics reports
issued by the Financial Services Authority (OJK). The
data was then analyzed using qualitative descriptive
methods.
The results of this study indicate that the
challenges faced by investors to invest in the
Indonesian capital market include: 1) Low estimated
stock returns to be obtained; and 2) The high risk of
stock investment. Both challenges can be interpreted
as negative signals that hinder investment decisions.
Therefore, it is necessary to apply a strategy to
increase stock prices in order to encourage increased
share liquidity and market capitalization to attract
investors to invest in the Indonesian capital market.
The strategy can be in the form of strategies for
improving internal performance of companies that are
listed in the capital market and strategies for creating
appropriate public policies to build social, political

In order to address the issue, research on public companies listed on the Indonesian stock exchange on LQ 45 companies is conducted. A model of multiple regression is used to explain what factors should be considered in carrying out the company’s dividend policy. The result of this study shows that main factors that should be considered in distributing the cash dividend are investment and leverage that may have an impact on the reduction of dividend. Size and liquidity variables do not affect dividend policy.

A model of multiple regression is used to explain what factors should be considered in carrying out the company’s dividend policy. The result of this study shows that main factors that should be considered in distributing the cash dividend are investment and leverage that may have an impact on the reduction of dividend. Size and liquidity variables do not affect dividend policy.

In addition, numerous empirical research findings about financial-based psychology have surfaced, strengthening suspicions about conventional financial conceptions. Therefore, the study of financial behavior should be expanded and investigated in greater depth to understand better how behavioral aspects influence individual investors. The study's primary objective is to investigate the behavioral bias factors that influence the investment decisions of individual investors in the Indonesian stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study will also attempt to analyze how behavioral biases influence the investment decisions ofindividual investors in the capital market, taking demographic factors into account. The study sample was comprised of 238 questionnaire recipients. A quantitative investigation employs primary data. The statistical testing instrument employed is SmartPLS version 3.3.2. Non-probability sampling is the method employed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the data demonstrated that behavioral bias factors strongly influenced investment decisions.
In contrast, demographic characteristics such as gender, age, education, income, and overall investment experience did not significantly influence the investment decisions of individual investors during the COVID-19 pandemic, either directly or by mitigating the aforementioned behavioral bias effects. Nevertheless, there are significant gender differences in the moderating effect of heuristic and market bias on investment decisions. In addition, the investment experience variable reveals a significant difference between investors with a high level of experience and those with a low level of experience concerning the moderating effect of prospect bias on investment decision-making. This study has ramifications for investors' investment decisions. Behavioral and demographic aspects might be considered by investors when choosing investments.

The population of this research is companies listed on the LQ45 index for the period 2013–2016, and the sample is 20 companies that meet the criteria. Markowitz method was used to form 65 portfolios; each consists of a combination of two stocks that have a negative correlation. The result shows that there is no positive relationship between Value at Risk and Expected Portfolio Returns. On the contrary, the correlation coefficient indicated that there is a negative relationship between the variables, which means that there is an inverse relationship (high return low risk, and vice versa). It proves that the assumption of a rational investor is avoiding risk (risk averse). This result is also supported by the findings from Schroders Global Investment Trends Survey 2015, which shows that 63% of investors in Indonesia prefer to allocate their investments in instruments with low- and medium-risk levels.

During the pandemic, the stock market in Indonesia showed high volatility mainly due to unpredictable market conditions and unexpected investor behavior. Investors must show their rationality where their financial behavior should not be influenced by behavioral bias factors. Some of the behavioral bias factors that are of concern in this study are the presence of heuristic, prospect, market, and herding biases that affect investment decisions among individual investors in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this study begins with the basis of behavioral finance theory and then the formulation of the hypothesis is tested through the collection of questionnaires which have been obtained 295 respondents. Data were analyzed using a structural equation model (CB-SEM) with the help of LISREL 8.80 software.
The results identify that heuristic and market behavioral bias have a positive influence on individual investors' investment decisions, while behavioral bias factors such as prospects and herding negatively influence individual investors' investment decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.

FEB3,Free Float and Volatility Effect on Stock Liquidity in Indonesia Stock Exchange,"Liquidity is one of the important things in investing in the stock market. The Indonesia Stock 
Exchange as a regulator makes and establishes regulations in the capital market to conduct trading 
in an orderly, fair and efficient manner. One of the amended provisions in the regulation is regarding 
the free float or the percentage of the number of shares outstanding in the public with the aim of 
increasing the liquidity of the listed shares. In addition to free float, the risk in investing also needs to 
be considered. Behind a high return there is a high risk as well. High risk in the volatility of stock 
returns. High volatility attracts investors to invest in the stock market. Investors with risk-taking 
tendencies prefer this high-volatility condition because it allows them to earn higher returns, thereby 
increasing liquidity through the trading volume of these shares. This study involves a number of 
control variables that together determine market liquidity, namely Stock Return, Firm Size and Stock 
Price. The analysis was carried out on property and construction sector companies listed in the 
2016-2020 period. The analytical method used is multiple linear regression analysis using the E�Views 10 application. The results of the analysis found that free float and volatility have a positive 
effect on stock liquidity, either by including or including control variables. These results indicate that 
information about free float and volatility is a consideration in capital market investment decisions.",HG,"Asian Journal of Economics, Business and Accounting",2022-10-20,

The study was conducted during 2016-2019 on the official 45 liquid shares namely LQ45. In this study, six portfolios were formed, which were produced from small and large portfolio groups. Each portfolio consists of small high, medium, low and large portfolio consists of large, medium and low. The results showed that market risk for all small and large portfolios have a positive and significant effect. In contrast to company size, size has a significant effect on small, medium, low and large high portfolios. While large low and medium portfolios are not significant. Testing the effect of company value on small and large portfolio excess returns is significant except for the small low portfolio. In general, the three-factor research model is a pretty good model to explain portfolio excess returns in Indonesia.

The conclusion of this study is that cash holdings are only able to mediate the influence of corporate governance with a proxy proportion of the board independence on firm value. Directly cash holding and
corporate governance with a proxy proportion of the number of independent commissioners also influence the firm value while leverage, asymmetric information and corporate governance with a proxy percentage of the number of share ownership by managerial does not directly affect the firm value of the company.

The lowest levels of financial literacy is found at the capital market sector with only 4% and levels at capital market products only 0,1%. The Indonesian government through Authority of Financial Services (OJK) has a responsibility to educate and cultivate awareness for potential investors. OJK targets the national financial literacy levels to increase to 27,8% by 2016. Studies on the benefits of financial literacy programs remain controversial: the factors being researched are financial literacy and demographic factors. Furthermore this study also investigate the role of demographic factors in making more apparent the role of financial literacy towards the risk tolerance in relation to the behavior of investation in the capital market by potential investors. Number of respondents are  192 people. The data is collected using a questionnaire. The analysis method used is the Moderated Regresion Analysis (MRA). This study support that demographic factors are a significant determinant of  the level of tolerance towards risk, meanwhile the benefit of financial literacy is still inconsistent as a determinant of level of tolerance towards risk. However the role of demographic factors is not strong enough to improve the influence of financial literacy  to the level of risk tolerance. The advice for further research is  to develop similar research in the future to resolve the flaws of this research, by incorporating the behaviorial and psycological factors as factors which influence investor in making their decision to invest.

thoroughly and produces different factors. The empirical study of cash holding is still limited to
the elements of vigilance and transaction. Speculation aspects have not been much discussed in
determining the company's cash holding. The purpose of this study was to determine the religious
influence of the company's cash holding. The method used to test the model is using panel data
regression, using a sample of 193 companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. This research was
carried out by separating between shari'ah and non-shari'ah companies. The results of the
research are Religiosity (Islam Discotomic) showing a positive and significant coefficient of cash

FEB6,VALUE OF EXCESS CASH HOLDINGS OF FINANCIALLY UNCONSTRAINED COMPANIES,"This study provides an investigation into the link between financial constraints and cash holdings from the perspective of a developing country. It is based on the view that managers acting as agents are managing firms on behalf of shareholders, which is leading to agency conflicts and hence giving rise to the Free Cash Flow
hypothesis. In addition, the management of cash looks at liquidity as well as the resources of a firm in order
to invest in future growth. The current study thus provides
a comparison  of the value of excess cash holdings by examining the impact of financial constraints.
Theanalys is is based on a single dimension, as well
as multiple criteria dimensions, where the findings 
indicate that excess cash holding is less valuable for
unconstrained companies.

This suggests that agency problems are the main motives
behind excess cash holdings for these companies.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that the values are
large for constrained firms providing insights into
the need for managers of these companies to evaluate cash management strategies in order to enhance corporate value.
Furthermore, it provides useful insight for regulators

FEB6,Value at Risk: Crude Oil Price during the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Since the end of 2019, world economic conditions have experienced a difficult time due to the determination of the Covid-19 corona virus outbreak as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the sectors that has felt the direct impact of this pandemic is the commodity sector, one of which is the crude oil commodity. The world crude oil price has decreased to reach a negative figure in the middle of Semester 1 2020, so that the level of uncertainty over the world crude oil price is relatively high due to fluctuations in the level of the economy. This study aims to measure the minimum level of risk posed by world crude oil prices through the Value at Risk (VaR) approach by applying the volatility rate modeling and the average Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. The results of the study found that the AR (1)-GARCH (1,1) model is the best model for measuring the level of volatility and the average world crude oil price which is used as a measure of the minimum risk level for the VaR model. Furthermore, from the calculation results, the VaR value obtained with a time period of 15 days and a confidence level of 95% is 0.039108 or 3.91%. This means, with the level of uncertainty over world economic conditions, the world crude oil price has the potential to decline by a maximum of 3.91%.",HG,,,

to provide Directorate General of Taxation to meet their liquidity constraint in developing
and shifting informal MSMEs. It is also engaged in the involvement of the MSMEs
platform based on ICT. The paper is based on conceptual explorations of literature in the
area of MSMEs and ICT. This paper is conceptual, so it did not employ any empirical
analysis. The findings of this paper will provide the Directorate General of Taxation with
an alternative model in developing and shifting informal MSMEs. The present study also
has implications for government and policymakers. By involving ICT's, it helps the

FEB6,CEK PLAGIARISME ARTIKEL: Value at Risk: Crude Oil Price during the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Since the end of 2019, world economic conditions have experienced a 
difficult time due to the determination of the Covid-19 corona virus outbreak 
as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the sectors 
that has felt the direct impact of this pandemic is the commodity sector, one of 
which is the crude oil commodity. The world crude oil price has decreased to 
reach a negative figure in the middle of Semester 1 2020, so that the level of 
uncertainty over the world crude oil price is relatively high due to fluctuations 
in the level of the economy. This study aims to measure the minimum level of 
risk posed by world crude oil prices through the Value at Risk (VaR) approach 
by applying the volatility rate modeling and the average Generalized 
Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. The results of 
the study found that the AR (1)-GARCH (1,1) model is the best model for 
measuring the level of volatility and the average world crude oil price which is 
used as a measure of the minimum risk level for the VaR model. Furthermore, 
from the calculation results, the VaR value obtained with a time period of 15 
days and a confidence level of 95% is 0.039108 or 3.91%. This means, with the 
level of uncertainty over world economic conditions, the world crude oil price 
has the potential to decline by a maximum of 3.91%.",HG,,2022-11-09,

SEBAGAI VARIABEL MEDIATOR","Abstract-MSMEs plays an important role to support Indonesia’s economic growth. There
is an urgency to increase the financial literacy and skills for MSMEs, especially in
managing their fund to make their businesses alive. The government believed that the
financial literacy was one way to achieve the society prosperity by taking advantage from
the collectivisim culture of Indonesian. This study is to examine the effect of financial
literacy on financial inclusion by using social capital mediation at MSMEs in South
Tangerang City. The questionnaires were distributed to some MSME’s district in South
Tangerang regency. All data collection were furthered analyzed using Structural
Equation Model on AMOS 24. The research showed that financial literacy does not affect
financial inclusion, financial literacy affects social capital and social capital as a
mediator variable on the relationship of financial literacy affects financial inclusion in
MSMEs in South Tangerang City. It can be concluded that there is an influence of social
capital that connects financial literacy to financial inclusion. All the stakeholders in the
financial ecosystem in Indonesia, including financial institutions and the government as
regulators, will be better to use the power of social capital to increase financial literacy
and financial inclusion in Indonesia.",HG,Ultima Management : Jurnal Ilmu Manajemen,2020-06-19,

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui seberapa besar Value at Risk yang dihasilkan dari aset tunggal dan portofolio serta untuk mengetahui seberapa besar proporsi saham yang optimal. Value at Risk (VaR) dalam penelitian ini diukur dengan menggunakan metode Simulasi Monte Carlo dengan cara membangkitkan nilai random berdasarkan karakteristik data, yang kemudian digunakan untuk mengestimasi nilai VaR-nya. Pembentukan portofolio dalam penelitian ini digunakan untuk menghitung proporsi dana investasi dengan menggunkan metode Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan VaR pada aset tunggal mempunyai nilai paling rendah sebesar 2% yang dimiliki oleh saham BBCA dan VaR tertinggi 8% yang dimiliki oleh saham ERAA. Dari hasil analisis portofolio optimal diperoleh 6 saham yang masuk dalam portofolio optimal dan proporsi saham tertinggi dimiliki oleh BBCA sebesar 38% dan terendah dimiliki oleh TKIM sebesar 1%. Dari proporsi tersebut diperoleh perhitungan VaR portofolio sebesar 0,03% yang menunjukkan bahwa VaR Portofolio lebih rendah dari masing-masing saham yang diteliti. Populasi dalam penelitian ini terbatas hanya pada 45 perushaan yang termasuk dalam indeks LQ-45 selama periode 1 Januari – 31 Desember 2019 sehingga sampel yang dapat digunakan dalam penelitian ini hanya terbatas sebanyak 12 perusahaan. Penelitian ini diharapkan dapat berguna sebagai masukan bagi investor untuk menganalisis tingkat risiko dan pembentukan portofolio serta diharapkan dapat menjadi masukan bagi perusahaan dalam mengelola risiko yang telah diestimasikan dan meningkatkan nilai perushaan.

previous calculations, it can be seen that the value of the F-statistic was 35.186 with
the probability value of the F-statistic being 0.000. Since the prob value of the F-
statistic was 0.000<0.05 then H0 was rejected, meaning that together the ownership
structure has a significant effect on firm value. The study concluded that
Institutional Ownership, Foreign Ownership and Individual Ownership have a
significant effect on Firm Value. An increase in institutional ownership will reduce
the value of the company and vice versa. Foreign ownership has a positive effect
on firm value on the IDX which has been proven empirically and supports the
statements of previous researchers. Individual ownership has a negative effect on
company value on the IDX, as has been shown in previous studies, where the higher
the individual ownership, the lower the company value.","HG, HJ",Economía & Negocios,2023-04-12,

FEB3,"OVERCONFIDENT BEHAVIOR IN A SECURITY MARKET, THE IMPLICATION OF SELF DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR IN PRICE DISCOVERY PROCESSES – A MARKET EXPERIMENT","People may suffer from overconfidence in their daily activities. According to
psychological research, less informed individuals may suffer from overconfidence.
Empirical research shows that investors suffer from transaction losses due to
overconfidence. This current research is an experimental research project that addresses
these issues. According to the research design, all investors are classified into three
groups based on their scores of overconfidence, namely the less informed investors, the
rational (average) investors, and the more informed investors. In order to observe the
responses of the groups of investors when they receive valuable information, the research
employs four different types of treatments consisting of the condition of no market
information, the provision of guidance of security prediction, the good news and the bad
news.
 The research demonstrates that the less informed investors are inclined to assess the
precision of their knowledge and information excessively so that they produce a higher
mean of prediction and price errors than those of the more informed investors in all
experimental market sessions, except in the market session of good news. The phenomenon
indicates that less informed investors conduct a self deceptive behavior. The result of the
research also shows that although the less informed investors have higher mean of
prediction or price errors, they have a chance to gain profit as long as they are able to
deliver the predicted value of the security accurately which is closer to the market price
that reflects the expected price of the majority of the market players.

The contribution of environmental Non-profit Organisations (NPOs) in solving Indonesia’s environmental problems has become increasingly important, and stakeholders should monitor NPOs performance in order to keep providing benefits to the society. This research provides a description of Indonesian environmental NPOs’ financial performance; their fiscal performance, fundraising efficiency, and public support, as well as assesses the compliance of said NPOs’ financial statements with generally accepted accounting standards for non-profit entities in Indonesia. Using financial ratios tested by Ritchie and Kolodinsky (2003), this study concludes that the focus organisation presented a favourable financial performance in the observed 5-year period. This research also found that the aforesaid financial statements are in accordance with prevailing standards, including PSAK 45. This research also identified problems surrounding financial performance, such as minuscule participation from individual donors due to religious background of the demography.

FEB6,OVERCONFIDENCE INVESTORS IN INDONESIA'S SHARIA CAPITAL MARKET: Experimental Study,"Investors who have high overconfidence indicated by a high rate of miscalculation will tend to overestimate the price of securities so that they unknowingly buy securities at a higher price or sell securities at a price lower than their fundamental value, causing transaction losses. This paper discusses the overconfident and predictive accuracy of stock prices in the Indonesian Islamic capital market with an experimental laboratory setting to observe investor responses when they receive valuable information. The research design classifies investors into three groups based on overconfidence scores. This study uses two types of treatment, namely market conditions without information and markets receiving bad news. The results show that overconfident investors tend to overestimate the accuracy of their knowledge and information so that they produce higher average and error price predictions than investors who are low overconfident across all experimental market sessions. This evidence suggests that highly confident investors engage in self-deceptive behavior. The results also show that investors who are overconfident do not always suffer losses even though they have higher average prediction errors or prices than investors who are overconfident low.

The test results show that the disclosure of environmental information by food and beverage companies in Indonesia increased significantly after the legislation was issued. Thes finding suggests that since the Indonesia government ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2004, Indonesia companies are more transparent in terms of informing the public about the environmental conservation activities that they do.
The study aslo found that there is a positive relationship between the allocation of research and development costs associated with thw reduction of the company’s carbon emissions during the year of observation. Significant relationships were also found in 2007 when the government issued Low No.40 of 2007. However, in 2012 we did not find a significant relationship. This study concluded that the legal instruments that require companies to reduce carbon emissions is urgently needed in developing countries like Indonesia. This policy will also determine the success of Indonesia in realizing the commitments to reduce carbon emissions.",HG,,2016,

The motivation of this study is that there is no study in Indonesia concerning the presentation of the Management's Discussion and Analysis that affect investors' decision to invest in an enterprise, which is illustrated by the market reaction to stock returns and trading volume activity. There are 827 samples in this study in the period of 2011-2013.

Previous research shows the results that CEO turnover is inconclusive with respect to its antecedent factors and consequences. It is also very rarely observed in Indonesia, and therefore strongly encourages the author to conduct this study. The samples of this study is all the companies performing turnover (either routine or non-routine) at the level of the company's top leaders in office as President Director. The sample included 81 CEOs which experienced turnover from 1998 to 2006 period, and compared with a control group referring to companies that does not perform CEO turnover during the observation period (nine years). The final sample that we used for testing the accounting data is as much as 140 companies, consisting of 81 companies that performed turnover and 59 companies that did not. The results of study show that accounting data (i.e. total assets, total sales, ROA, ROE and earnings), indicates a significant negative effect on turnover decisions, while current ratio does not. In additional tests, we find that the accounting performance on non-routine turnover compares favourably with CEO turnover on the type of routine. This result indicates a bargaining position of CEOs at a company that does change regularly. Meanwhile, worse accounting performance will have the potential for CEOs to be replaced (down position or enter into a council of commissioners) and even be laid off from the company.",HG,Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business,2011,

The samples obtained were 59 manufacturing companies consisting of 16 companies in conventional stock and 43 companies in sharia stock in periods of 2016-2018. Dividend policy is highly import­ ant in corporate financial decisions. In several countries, concentrated ownership struc­ tures, such as family or individual ownership, institutional ownership, and foreign ownership, have low dividend payments. Thus, the presence of a concentrated ownership structure in Indonesia has the possibility to pay low dividends. Furthermore, sharia shares to develop quite rapidly in Indonesia.

Penelitian ini menjelaskan pelaksanaan e-procurement dari sisi kelembagaan dan metode pelaksanaan serta tingkat efisiensi penggunaan keuangan negara dalam pelaksanaan e-procurement di Universitas Lampung tahun anggaran 2013 dan 2014. Dengan asumsi terdapat dua pendekatan utama dalam mengukur dampak suatu program yakni, “with and without approach” dan “before and after approach”, maka pendekatan yang dilakukan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan before and after approach yakni analisis yang memerlukan kondisi sebelum dan setelah treatment (e-procurement) dilakukan di Universitas Lampung yang dianalisis dengan pendekatan kualitatif. Tiga tingkatan efisiensi yaitu efisiensi teknis, efisiensi ekonomis, dan efisiensi alokatif mengarahkan pada pilihan substansi dari penelitian ini yaitu efisiensi ekonomis dengan tiga fokus, yaitu efisiensi waktu, efisiensi biaya, dan efisiensi hasil.
Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pada tiga aspek efisiensi seluruhnya telah dapat dicapai. Dari sisi waktu, dalam pengadaan barang dengan pelelangan sederhana misalnya, jika dilaksanakan secara manual dibutuhkan waktu minimal 28 (dua puluh) delapan hari kerja, namun jika dilaksanakan dengan metode eprocurement hanya membutuhkan waktu 22 (dua puluh dua) hari kalender. Hari kerja dan hari kalender tentu berbeda. Pada sisi biaya, kebutuhan dana untuk biaya transportasi (untuk mendaftar dan memasukkan penawaran), biaya komunikasi (untuk mengikuti rapat penjelasan), biaya penggandaan (untuk penggandaan dokumen pelelangan), biaya pencetakan (untuk dokumen penawaran) serta lainnya dapat ditiadakan, karena seluruhnya dilakukan dengan cara elektronik. Secara kuantitas dapat disimpulkan bahwa pemberlakuan eprocurement di Universitas Lampung telah menghasilkan efisiensi sebesar 22,4% dibandingkan dengan pagu anggaran yang diturunkan ke dalam Harga Perkiraan Sendiri (HPS). Hal ini berarti telah terjadi efisiensi pada aspek efisiensi hasil. Dari jumlah nilai HPS di Universitas Lampung tahun anggaran 2013 dan 2014 sebesar 192,1 miliar rupiah telah terjadi efisiensi hasil yang setara dengan 25,9 miliar rupiah.","HG, HJ",,2015,

An event study was conducted to detect the presence of abnormal returns during the releases of media news regarding unethical practices of Indonesian listed companies in environmental, social and financial aspects. The examples of unfavorable environmental practices are illegal lodging, forest fires, and pollutions, while in social aspects it includes labor strikes and lay-offs, market monopoly, and similar practices. Unethical practices in financial aspect includes frauds and tax evasions. Prior studies from more developed nations have been widely documented in the literature. However, the use of media reports of three different aspects to measure the event is new to the study. The results of prior studies, which mostly come from developed markets, have also been inconclusive. The use of a sample from a developing market is expected to provide distinct contribution to the existing literature.  The results show that Indonesian stock market responded to media news regarding corporate unethical behaviors, particularly in social aspect, as indicated by negative abnormal returns in the third day after the news releases by prominent online newspapers, Kompas. When such information is split into each category, namely: environmental, social, financial information, the result is only consistent for social issues.  Negative abnormal returns occurred on the third day after the media reports of unethical social behaviors of the sample firms. However, we did not find significant market responses to media reports of unfavorable financial and environmental practices by the sample companies. Using paired sample t-tests to examine the market response before and after the event, this study only finds significant difference in cumulative abnormal returns for unfavorable social practices.

The population of this study is 33 banks listed at the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the period between 2008 and 2012. Based on the sampling criteria, 23 banks were selected for this study. The model used in this study is the path models with Intellectual capital dimensions as the independent variable, and financial performance (ROA) as the intervening variable that mediates intellectual capital on the firm value. The study indicated that intellectual capital affected the financial performance by 78.5 %, while the collective intellectual capital and financial performance affected the firm value by 16.3 %. These results suggest that intellectual capital contributed more to the financial performance compared to the firm value. This happened because the Indonesian capital market's investors, are still oriented towards tangible asset valuation compared to the intangible assets as the intellectual capital/ knowledge assets. Intellectual capital with financial performance as an intervening variable is able to contribute to the increase in the firm's value. In other words, the market gives a higher value to companies that have higher financial performance that are able to manage the intellectual resources effectively and efficiently.",HG,,2015-05,

The population of this research is companies listed on the LQ45 index for the period 2013–2016, and the sample is 20 companies that meet the criteria. Markowitz method was used to form 65 portfolios; each consists of a combination of two stocks that have a negative correlation. The result shows that there is no positive relationship between Value at Risk and Expected Portfolio Returns. On the contrary, the correlation coefficient indicated that there is a negative relationship between the variables, which means that there is an inverse relationship (high return low risk, and vice versa). It proves that the assumption of a rational investor is avoiding risk (risk averse). This result is also supported by the findings from Schroders Global Investment Trends Survey 2015, which shows that 63% of investors in Indonesia prefer to allocate their investments in instruments with low- and medium-risk levels. However, it does not mean that the concept of high-risk high-return is not applicable in Indonesia because the result is not significant.",HG,,2017,

this goal obviously requires different approach, methodology wise. Cross section regression-based studies have utilized what is called

Fuller (1979) is employed to test for convergence hypothesis. Employing ADF test also serves two purposes: 1) the methods has to be 
used to provide input for performing simulations to apply SURADF procedure. Developed by Blundell and Bond (1998), system GMM 
uses additional moment conditions to serve as an improvement in terms of performance of estimators in the models developed in Arellano

commercial banks in Indonesia before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, with a major focus on
capital, asset quality, profitability, and management efficiency based on BUKU (Bank Umum
Kegiatan Usaha - Commercial Bank Business Activities). The data used in this study is secondary
data, which consists of the 2015-2019 financial statements and the 1st quarter 2020 - the 3rd
quarter 2020 financial statements. The sample used in this study amounted to 38 banks. The
analytical method used is the Kruskal-Wallis test using the IBM SPSS version 25 software. The
results of data processing and data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test show that there are
differences in the capital (CAR), asset quality (NPL), profitability (ROA), and management
efficiency (BOPO) of banking companies between BUKU 2, BUKU 3, and BUKU 4 before and during

Some of the industries most impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic are those in the hotel, restaurant, and tourism industries. This study uses profitability and leverage to examine whether there are differences in the profitability and leverage situations before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. There are discrepancies between the findings of earlier studies, notably those by Darmawan et al., (2021), who found no differences between profitability before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. In this research, a comparative descriptive methodology and a quantitative technique were applied. From 2018 through 2022, financial statistics are used in this analysis. Purposive sampling was used to collect samples,  and  25  companies  that  match  the  criteria  were  found.When  data  were  not  normally distributed, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed instead of the paired sample t-test as the normality test. The study's conclusion demonstrates the leverage and profitability of businesses in the travel, dining, and hospitality sectors both before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. In the 25 organizations that were analyzed, the results revealed a significant value (α) of 5% and a decline in the value of profitability and leverage. This indicates that the Indonesian hotel, restaurant, and tourism sub-sector businesses have suffered as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study's findings are anticipated tobe used to investment decision-making.Additionally, this research can be used  as  information  by  businesses  facing  profitability  and  leverage  issues  before  and  during  the pandemic so that they can take immediate action to maintain their operations going forward.","HG, HJ",Asian Journal of Economics and Business Management,2022-08-13,

terhadap Nilai Perusahaan dengan Kebijakan Deviden 
sebagai Variabel Moderasi (Effect of Profitability, Leverage, and Capital Structure on Firm Value with Dividend Policy as Moderating Variable)","Purpose: The COVID-19 epidemic has had a devastating impact on 
the international economy, particularly in Indonesia. The 
hospitality, dining, and tourism sectors are some of those most 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of profitability, 
leverage, capital structure, and dividend policy as moderating 
variables on firm value is investigated in this study for companies in 
the hotel, restaurant, and tourism sub-sector listed on the Indonesian 
stock exchange between 2016 and 2021.
Method: With data from the Indonesian stock exchange from 2016 
to 2021, comparative descriptive approaches and quantitative 
methodologies were employed in this study. Purposive sampling 
was used to sample, and it revealed 15 businesses that fit the bill.
Results: The findings in 15 companies show that profitability has no 
effect on firm value, with a significance value of 0,584; leverage has 
no effect on firm value, with a significance value of 0,896; capital 
structure has no effect on firm value, with a significance value of 
0,122; dividend policy is able to moderate profitability on firm 
value, with a significance value of 0,025; dividend policy is unable 
to moderate the effect of leverage; and capital structure has no effect 
on firm value.
Limitations: This study only uses the variables of profitability, 
leverage, capital structure, dividend policy to explain the variable 
value of the company, with a sample of companies in the hotel, 
restaurant and tourism sub-sector listed on the Indonesian stock 
exchange during 2016-2021.
Contribution: The results of this study will likely be applied in 
investment decision-making. Businesses with concerns about 
profitability, debt, and capital structure can also utilize this 
research's findings as knowledge so they can act right away to keep 
their operations going in the future.","HG, HJ",Goodwood Akuntansi dan Auditing Reviu,2022-11-01,

Thus, it would be very difficult for investors to get above normal profit levels consistently. The average stock trading transactions after that event was relatively higher. This showed that there was an increase in demand for stocks although the increase was not significant. We found that stock trading volume increased after that event. That indicated that the stock was in demand by investors. The tick size change caused the variation of the supply and demand price to be greater so that it would increase the risk.

no longer entitled to receive dividends so that it can cause stock prices to decline. Previous research found that there
is a positive abnormal return before the ex dividend date and will decrease after the ex dividend date. However, the
phenomenon of increasing stock prices before the ex dividend date and decreasing stock prices after the ex dividend
date is still a debate for researchers. This study aims to provide empirical evidence on the difference in the average
abnormal returns of big caps, medium caps and small caps stocks before and after the ex dividend date on the Indonesia

distributing dividends for three consecutive years. The results showed that dividend policy has an effect on stock

Sedangkan ex dividend date adalah hari tanpa dividen atau investor tidak lagi berhak menerima dividen sehingga dapat menyebabkan harga saham turun. Penelitian sebelumnya menemukan bahwa terdapat abnormal return yang positif sebelum tanggal ex dividen dan akan menurun setelah tanggal ex dividen. Namun fenomena kenaikan harga saham sebelum ex dividend date dan penurunan harga saham setelah ex dividend date masih menjadi perdebatan para peneliti. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memberikan bukti empiris tentang perbedaan rata-rata abnormal return saham big caps, medium caps dan small caps sebelum dan sesudah ex dividend date di Bursa Efek Indonesia periode 2019-2021. Sampel penelitian terdiri dari 94 perusahaan dengan kriteria sampel membagikan dividen selama tiga tahun berturut-turut. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kebijakan dividen berpengaruh terhadap abnormal return saham. Rata-rata, harga saham untuk semua kapitalisasi cenderung meningkat sebelum tanggal ex-dividend dan menurun setelah tanggal ex-dividend. Penelitian ini juga menemukan bahwa ukuran perusahaan berkorelasi negatif dengan rata-rata return saham. Artinya saham dengan ukuran kecil akan menghasilkan rata-rata return yang lebih tinggi dibandingkan saham perusahaan besar.","HG, HJ",GEMA EKONOMI (Jurnal Fakultas Ekonomi) Fakultas Ekonomi Universitas Gresik,2022,
