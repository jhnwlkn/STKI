The writing method uses a literature review and data that will be obtained through literature studies, such as books, scientific journals, websites, and other things. Things that are relevant to the problem under study. The results and analysis in this paper indicate that the presence of a new party in the upcoming 2024 elections will be political years that are on the verge of vulnerability and division, while a powerful strategy to minimize divisions is to instill an internal party democracy system, so that internal conflicts between members in the party does not happen again. Another challenge is that disruption will hijack the role of political parties if political parties are reluctant to follow the flow of disruption. In the era of disruption, the emergence of political parties provides opportunities for mass mobilization during campaigns using social media which is considered more effective and has a broad and equitable reach. In addition, disruption can be used by political parties for party branding strategies. However, the bad impact of this disruption can lead to social media wars between political parties on various social media pages such as the spread of hoax news.",JQ,Nakhoda: Jurnal Ilmu Pemerintahan,2022-06-30,
FISIP6,The Future of Indonesian Patronage Democracy: Political Campaign Financing Reform,"This study aims to see the relationship between patterns of patronage, clientelism, money politics, and campaign financing within the framework of patronage democracy that occurs in Indonesia. This paper uses the literature review method, the use of this method is related to the practice of patronage democracy and campaign financing which limits researchers in data collection. Data collection is done by collecting various books, scientific articles or journals related to the problem and research objectives. The results of this paper describe the pattern of patronage causing the large campaign costs incurred by each party and the candidate it nominates. The amount of money spent on campaigns can lead to acts of corruption. The solution offered in this paper has two points. First, campaign funding is financed 100% by the state, meaning that no other source of funds is allowed to enter the party. Thus, parties and candidates do not need to look for other sources of funds, so as to avoid the political potential of the party's debt of gratitude to fund owners from outside the party. Second, utilizing social media by conducting campaigns through social media because social media provides an open space with available features. Campaigns using social media can also minimize the expenditure of funds disbursed by the candidates. Thus, efforts to carry out money politics or vote buying will be reduced.",JQ,PERSPEKTIF,2022-10,

FISIP6,BUDAYA POLITIK LAMPUNG,"ABSTRAK 

Budaya politik dapat diartikan sebagai suatu sistem nilai bersama dari masyarakat yang memiliki kesadaran untuk berpartisipasi dalam pengambilan keputusan kolektif dan penentuan kebijakan publik bagi seluruh masyarakat. Pada masa kini, berbagai daerah di Indonesia sedang berproses secara reformatif berupaya meninggalkan budaya politik otoriter peninggalan masa Orde Baru menuju budaya politik demokratis.

Pespektif idealis menekankan pentingnya norma dan etika dalam budaya politik yang berlandaskan pada nilai-nilai kearifan lokal “Piil Pesenggiri”. Pinsip hidup “Piil Pesengiri” bagi masyaakat adat Lampung merupakan kehormatan diri, malu bersalah, dan perasaan harga diri. Sedangkan perspektif realis mendeskripsikan budaya politik Lampung dari fenomena politik-pemerintahan lokal. Dalam perspektif ini, budaya Lampung telah menjadi sumber kekuasaan untuk menguasai, mempengaruhi, dan mendominasi identitas, perilaku, penguasaan sumberdaya dan kebijakan di birokrasi pemerintahan. Dari sisi realitas sosial-politik, fenomena menguatnya budaya Lampung yang dipolitikkan adalah bentuk dari perlawanan politik terhadap keberadaan pemerintah pusat di era Orde Baru, yang melakukan penyeragaman dan menempatkan daerah sebagai subordinasi pemerintah pusat.",JQ,Lampung Post,2016-11-24,

FISIP6,The relationship between different social factors and the intensity of student radicalism,"The act of terrorism stimulated by the notion of radicalism in Indonesia is not a new phenomenon. It has indeed existed since the beginning of Indonesia’s independence; The forms, actors, motives, and movements radicalism are, however, different. Recently, there has been a growing discourse on radicalism among young Indonesians. This study investigated the relationship between four social factors, namely, religiosity, religious tolerance, relative deprivation, and social capital (independent variables) and the intensity of radicalism among school students (dependent variable) in Lampung, Indonesia. Three public schools and three madrasas were taken as research samples. Data were collected using a questionnaire based on the extant literature and analyzed using chi-square and correspondence analysis. Each variable was found to have a relationship pattern with the intensity of student radicalism. The analysis revealed that two social factors, namely, religiosity and religious tolerance, had the strongest relationship with the intensity of radicalism. To reduce the impact of the intensity of radicalism, it is very important for the world of education to exercise social control over the relative backwardness of high school/Madrasah Aliyah students and provide social capital through an effective understanding of socialization process in schools. The expected implication is that the government, especially stakeholders in the education sector, must pay attention to the concerns of students as victims of radicalism and focus on the social factors and drivers of the intensity of radicalism so that students do not fall prey to radicalism.

Aset-aset ekonomi secara dominan dikuasai oleh etnis Tionghoa termasuk di provinsi kepulauan Bangka Belitung ini.

Kemunculan etnis Tionghoa dalam artian positif mengindikasikan bahwa polarisasi etnis telah mati di Bangka-Belitung.

(2)	identify the source of external conflict, and (3) analyze conflict management applied to resolve the conflict. This research’s method is qualitative descriptive, data were collected through interviews with purposive informants and documentation. Research shows that conflict was mainly caused by lack of regulation and human resources factors which can be specified into internal conflict were caused by personal factors such as (1) communicational barrier; (2) conflict of interest in recruitment; (3) character differences. Functional factors were disproportioned structure and lack of competence. External conflicts were mainly caused by lack of regulation resulted in misperceptions and also personal and intervention factors. By using the framework of organizational conflict management, it has become clear that the General Election Commission of Palembang applied different approaches to conflict management: forcing and withdrawal for ad hoc electoral body, and institutional (legal approach) in dealing with the Election Supervisory Agency of Palembang. Although they might produce some agreements, those types of conflict management were not leading to genuine resolution since it was a win-lose pattern. It is important to formulate rigid regulation, enhance the competence of election organizers, develop check and balance coordination, and synergize as fellow election organizers to avoid conflict reoccurrence in the future.

FISIP3,A post-tsunami sea change? Towards post-secular disaster response in Indonesia,"The role of religious actors in disaster response, an issue that is generally understood as being dominated by secular perspectives, is increasingly receiving attention. Surprisingly considering its likelihood to offer relevant insights, however, the concept of post-secularism has seldom been adopted as an analytical framework. In response, in this study we adopt a Habermasian lens to examine the relations between religious and secular actors in Indonesia with respect to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, with particular focus on domestic faith organisations. Through interviewing representatives from three prominent religious organisations and a figure from a relevant independent statutory authority, we highlight these institutions' contributions to the disaster response, alongside their struggles to legitimise their leadership potential. Thus, by demonstrating the existence of constraints on religious groups playing a consequential role in a public concern that would benefit from multiple perspectives and competencies, we exemplify how Habermas’ vision of a post-secular society is playing out in a disaster context and identify areas in which collaboration between ostensibly secular and religious actors might be improved.","GE, H1, JQ",A post-tsunami sea change?

Beragam reaksi tentunya bermunculan sebagai respons terhadap ide Kementerian Pendayagunaan Aparatur Negara dan Reformasi Birokrasi (Kemenpan-Rebiro) itu. Setidaknya ada tiga kelompok yang merespons hal itu. Kelompok pertama ialah kelompok yang setuju dengan usulan pemerintah untuk mengevaluasi kinerja PNS selama ini. Alasan sederhana dan klasik, PNS ‘terkenal’ berkinerja lemah dan mengakibatkan pemborosan anggaran negara, apalagi Pemerintahan Jokowi-JK sedang giat-giatnya melakukan penghematan anggaran untuk dialihkan pada sektor produktif lain. Kelompok kedua ialah kelompok yang menentang keras rencana tersebut, baik bahasa mem-PHK, merasionalisasi, maupun evaluasi yang terdengar ‘mencemaskan’ di telinga mereka.","H1, JF, JQ",Menyelisik PHK Pegawai Negeri Sipil,2016-06-09,
FISIP6,"New Media, Incumbency and Malaysian Politics: The Defeat of the Barisan Nasional (BN) in GE14 (2018)","The Malaysian 14th General Election (GE14) has ended the political domination of Barisan Nasional (BN) of the last 61 years and resulted in a new discussion in Malaysian politics. The main purpose of this study is to explore the factors that caused BN to fail in the last election and to refine the incumbency theory posited by Hirano and Snyder Jr (2012) and Torcal (2014). We argue that various factors have contributed to the defeat of the BN government in the 14th GE, namely the 1MDB corruption scandal, the implementation of the progressive Good and Service Tax (GST), the rise of living costs, and the China-oriented foreign and economic policies, as well as the Mahathir factor. Our results also contribute to further developing incumbency theory. Instead of relying on traditional factor of incumbent defeat in election such as scandal and economic factors, the role of new media in spreading the news about the corruption scandal and the government’s economic underperformance have also contributed to a political shift in Malaysia.","J1, JA, JC, JQ","New Media, Incumbency and Malaysian Politics: The Defeat of the Barisan Nasional (BN) in GE14 (2018)",2023-01-22,

Change in Malaysia (New Media and 2018 Elections)","This is a study about the nexus relations among globalisation, democratisation process and its implication upon the political change in Malaysia. Malaysian internal politics is very dynamics and contentious as well as running based on the ethnic consensus. The result recent Malaysian election has changed the Malaysian political landscape. The 61 years regime of Barisan Nasional (BN) has been defeated by the opposition that led by former Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohammad. By applying qualitative library research. The result shows that the globalisation has a direct impact on the Malaysian democratisation progress.
It also, therefore, influences on creating a political change in Malaysia. This paper argues that globalisation and democratisation process became a trigger factor of new media development. The non BN-linked government media such as Malaysiakini.com and the Malaysian Insider play a significant role in distributing information related to the corruption scandal of BN elites, notably a corruption scandal of Najib Razak, a former Prime Minister of
Malaysia.

FISIP3,"The Political Legacies of Transmigration and the Dynamics of Ethnic Politics: a case study from Lampung, Indonesia","This paper discusses the political legacies of transmigration in local elections in Indonesia. Lampung in the south of Sumatra has an unusual ethnic make-up because in the past 100 years both the Dutch colonial administration and Indonesian Government have been implementing a transmigration programme, attempting to move people from densely populated areas to less densely populated ones. Transmigration has therefore changed the demographic pattern of Lampung, with the result that native Lampungese, who were in a majority in the 1930s, had become a minority ethnic group by 2010. Since 2005, the mode of local election has been changed from indirect to direct. As a consequence of this, there is a revival of ethnic identity politics in local elections. In this paper, we focus on a transmigration affected area where the descendants of Javanese transmigrants are numerically dominant and correspondingly powerful in local politics. This research leads us to argue that, as a result of the country’s decentralization policies and elections for local government offices, ethnicity has become an important factor in local elections and in transmigration affected areas has led to the political domination of Javanese transmigrant descendants in local politics. We further show how, in response to this situation, native Lampungese elites have adopted a number of strategies to help them retain a role in local politics. Our argument runs contrary to that of some scholars who have claimed that ethnicity is playing a diminishing role in Indonesian local elections.","G1, JA, JQ, JS, JV",Asian Ethnicity,2021-02-21,
