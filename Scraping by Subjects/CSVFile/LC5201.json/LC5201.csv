Pembangunan yang
berkelanjutan (sustainability development) syarat dengan kebutuhan SDM yang kompeten baik secara intelektual, kemampuan aplikatif maupun sikap yang mencerminkan karakteristik budaya Indonesia dan tuntutan zaman. Kurikulum
sebagai sarana untuk mewujudkan SDM yang handal tersebut baik secara ide, desain dan implementasinya.
Dalam perkembangannya, kurikulum harus bersinergi dengan kondisi dan
perkembangan masyarakat dan ilmu pengetahuan. Saat ini kita sudah masuk pada
era digital, yaitu pemanfaatan teknologi teknologi informasi komunikasi khususnya digital yang sudah merambah pada semua segi kehidupan termasuk pada bidang pendidikan. Derasnya teknologi informasi dan komunikasi digital telah mengubah tataran kehidupan bahkan dianggap sebagai penggangu
(disruption). Era disruptif diartikan sebagai masa di mana bermunculan banyak sekali inovasi – inovasi yang tidak terlihat, tidak disadari oleh organisasi mapan sehingga mengganggu jalannya aktivitas tatanan sistem lama atau bahkan
menghancurkan sistem lama tersebut. Bagaimana dengan pendidikan apakah disruptif juga mempengaruhi pendidikan?. Fenomena yang terjadi di dunia usaha saat ini sudah banyak yang tidak mempersyaratkan ijasah ketika menerima pegawainya. Perusahaan tersebut hanya membutuhkan kompetensi sehingga uji kompetensi merupakan tahapan penting. Dampaknya, banyak perguruan tinggi dan sekolah yang dikenal di dunia
saat ini mulai goyang dan tidak sedikit tutup, dikutip dari Kavin Carey (2015) dalam bukunya “The End of College”. Yang berkembang pesat saat ini justru lembaga-lembaga pendidikan nonformal seperti lembaga kursus yang secara nyata
memberikan kompetensi kepada peserta didiknya. Neil Postman (2005) dalam bukunya “The End of Education” telah lama mengingatkan bahwa matinya pendidikan karena pengelolaan pendidikan kehilangan arah, yang terlihat hanya orang sibuk mengurus pendidikan yang tidak terarah. Arah pendidikan tentu saja menjadi focus perhatian dari bidang kurikulum, apakah kurikulum kedepan sudah mengantisipasi dan mengakomodasi era disurtif tersebut, sehingga pada gilirannya akan melahirkan SDM yang kompetitif. Prosiding ini mencoba memberikan alternatif jawaban terhadap hal tersebut melalui pemikiran-pemikiran para ahli bidang kurikulum yang memberikan
analisis perspektif kurikulum dalam menghadapi era digital dan era disurtif tersebut.

Some studies show that female students employed language learning strategies more often than male students (Oxford & Nyikos, 1989; Awang Hashim & Syed Sahil, 1994; Green and Oxford, 1995; Dreyer & Oxford, 1999). The present study was aimed to identify how gender affects the use of strategies in learning a local language in the environment where people in the country have a national language. A Non–probability sampling was used to collect data. With the Cronbach Alphas ranging from .79 to 82, mean scores of the use of language learning strategies the male and female students reported using were compared. In the present study it was found that metacognitive strategies were the strategies mostly used by female students and cognitive strategeis were the strategies mostly used by male students. This means that male students are likely to be more dependent on memorization than female students. Cognitive strategies which are characterized at least with memorization or rote learning in the present study tend to be used by male students","L1, LB1501, LC5201",Theory and Practice in Language Studies,2018-11,

the NLP97N69 and the Hahiwang. Both manuscripts are housed separately. The NLP97N69 manuscript wasfound in Indonesia, whereas the Hahiwang in Germany. A philological and paleographic approach was adopted to investigate the Lampung script's forms and variations in the ancient manuscripts. Both manuscripts were examined in conjunction with a presentation of the scriptwriter's Lampung script. After raising the Lampung
script, it was compared to the current script and Van der Tuuk's script table. Discrepancies were found out
between the characters in the two manuscripts, the contemporary script, and Van der Tuuk's table. Furthermore,
the gha script was found out to be unique to the NLP97N69 manuscript. It was created in an attempt to meet the
needs of Lampung language users who desired a unique script that incorporated the gha sound. This study
demonstrates that the Lampung script has evolved and changed over time in response to its users' needs.

Data was collected by the Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with three steps; a preliminary investigation, design, and realization / construction. It was involving six experts and four practitioners. Validation of the construct is in the form of expert judgment. The opinions of experts and practitioners were analyzed descriptively, while the reliability of the instrument was analyzed by Cronbach's Alpha.
The results showed that there were 7 indicators of learning model developed from five aspects;  rational theoretical (2 indicators and 11-item criteria), syntax (1 indicator and three item criteria), the principle of interaction (1 indicator and 7 item criteria), social systems ( 1 indicator and three item criteria) and the impact of learning (2 indicators and criteria item 7). The measurement results were using 3-scale models of learning; 1 (= if the indicator is less good / less logical), 2 (= if the indicator is good enough / illogical) and 3 (= if the indicator is good / logical). Assessment categories were grouped into three; No Good (TB), Good (B) and Very Good (SB).  Reliability value questionnaires are rational theoretical aspects of 0.89, the syntax of 0.81, 0.93 interaction principle, the social system and the impact of learning 0.86 0.84. Based on reliability testing all aspects of the value of Cronbach's Alpha of 0.94, thus all items contained in the questionnaire are reliable and all indicators internally consistent because they have a strong reliability.","L1, LB1501, LC5201",,2016,

Dunia seni dan pendidikan seni merupakan dua hal yang berbeda dan memiliki karakteristik yang berbeda. Ranah seni hanya berorientasi kepada penciptaan (karya) tanpa mementingkan aspek didaktis di dalamnya, sedangkan ranah pendidikan seni hampir mencakup seluruh aspek, mulai dari penciptaan, pemahaman teori dan praktis, sampai kepada kemampuan akademis lain seperti menulis karya ilmiah. Dalam penulisan karya tulis ilmiah, kita (mahasiswa pendidikan seni) hampir memiliki permasalahan yang sama, baik itu menulis tugas harian berupa makalah, maupun tugas akhir berupa skripsi. Banyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan kurangnya kemampuan menulis ini, mulai dari kompetensi pengajar, malas, sistem pendidikan, sampai kepada porsi sebaran mata kuliah yang menawarkan penulisan karya ilmiah. Seorang mahasiswa pendidikan seni memang dididik untuk menjadi seorang  guru atau pengajar, tetapi pada prosesnya ternyata banyak sekali kegiatan dan tuntutan akademis yang harus dilalui. Sehingga menyebabkan kurangnya porsi waktu untuk belajar menulis karya ilmiah.

FKIP1,Technology and language learning: EFL learners’ use of smartphones for online informal learning in Indonesia (similarity report),"A considerable number of studies on mobile-assisted language learning have been conducted, but less attention has been paid to online informal learning of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) performed using smartphones among undergraduate EFL
learners in Indonesia. Thus, this study was specifically aimed at investigating EFL learners’ most frequently-performed EFL learning activities through smartphones, the predominant
online language use, and the relationship between EFL learners’ predominant online language use and their perceived EFL proficiency. The study adopted a quantitative approach. The findings reveal that the participants still more frequently access content and
information from their smartphones for receptive rather than interactive/productive online
activities. Indonesian, which is the participants’ first language, is still predominantly used for their online activities. The mean score of the perceived EFL proficiency of those who frequently perform online activities in English is statistically and significantly higher than those performing online activities in Indonesian. Overall, the mean score of the perceived EFL proficiency of those performing online activities in English is higher than those in Indonesian, although the difference is not statistically significant. Finally, the study’s implications with suggestions for future research are discussed","L1, LB1501, LC5201, PE",Arts & Humanities (language and Linguistics),2020,

This is because that policy implementation is basically a complex involving many supporting factors. The purpose of this study is to determine the factors supporting the implementation of decentralization policies on school perfomaance, so we hope to share ideas in order to contribute ideas in imroving the school's perfomance in the implemntation of education decentralization policies.
This study uses a quantitative approach, a non-experimental design model in conducted in junior high school in Bandar Lampung. Samples were taken by first determining the minimum sample using the formula of cohen (1977) subsequenly used proportionate stratified random sampling technique. Data collected by quistionnaires that apply to school principals, teachers, students, and school committes. Then it analyzed by SEM using the LISREL program.
The research revealed that the school enviritment, target group policy, school organization and management process is a direct and meaningful support to the implementation of decentralization policies on the school perfomance. While implementing school policies and school resources are indirectly supporting the perfomance of the implentation od decentralization polices in education units through the process of managing the school organization. Another finding is that the implementers of policies  and school resources are a factor for direct support to process of managing the school organization. Direct and major supporting factor to the prfomance of policy implemntation decetraliztion in school is the policy target groups in the sequence followed by the school envirotment. school organization and management process implemnters of school policy.","L1, LB1501, LC5201",,2020-06-26,

However, when the learning process takes place, the issue that arises is a lack of supervision and variances in each student's learning motivation, having a significant impact on how much knowledge learners can accept. Therefore, we believe it was desirable to conduct a study into the impact of the Powtoon application on student learning motivation. This research employed a comparison method, with a total of 84 participants taking part in the present study. They were students of the eleventh grade of a state Islamic high school located in a rural area in Central Lampung, Lampung Province, Indonesia. They
majored in social studies and were divided into two groups: 41 students in the control group and 43 in the experimental. The collected data were then analyzed using an Independent Samples T-test. The results show that the use of the Powtoon Application could increase students' learning motivation where the mean value increased significantly from 62.69 to 72.31, and the increase in motivation of the experimental
group was higher than the control group, with the T-test result showing a significance value of <0.05. Thus,
the Powtoon Application can boost student learning motivation and be used as a useful learning tool in the online learning process.

FKIP8,MUSTAHIL? MEMBANGUN BUDAYA LITERASI TANPA OLAH SASTRA,"Mengakui secara objektif adanya keragaman budaya yang ada di sekitar kita dapat dimaknai sebagai suatu prestasi. Lain halnya bagi yang mengabaikan adanya keragaman budaya—dapat diprediksi hanya memiliki sikap apriori, bahkan tak
ada kejelasan dalam pemilikan jatidiri. Tanpa disadari, hal ini terus tumbuh subur bagi masyarakat yang kurang mampu memanfaatkan potensi diri dalam memahami tata nilai yang terkandung dalam produk budaya. Hal ini patut diatasi
secara konkret agar keragaman dapat dijadikan anugerah, sekaligus aset bangsa melalui pemberdayaan program literasi secara simultan. Salah satu konsep praktis-pragmatis adalah menumbuhsuburkan budaya baca sejak dini secara formal maupun nonformal, terutama tata nilai yang tertuang dalam teks sastra. Selain etika dan estetika, teks sastra (seperti: cerpen dan novel) secara konseptual maupun sosial mecerminkan realitas-objektif kehidupan sosok manusia dengan segala keanehan perilakunya. Adanya kesadaran olahsastra secara apresiatif akan memberikan manfaat secara impresif maupun ekspresif, bahkan secara perlahan dapat menginspirasi alam pikir pembaca secara objektif. Deskripsi yang tersaji
apik, secara naratif mampu mengilhami pembaca secara perlahan manakala budaya baca melekat erat pada pembaca untuk beradab dan berkarakter. Namun, realita di masyarakat tampaknya makin puruk karena rendahnya budaya literasi, tak terkecuali juga terjadi di kalangan akademisi. Inilah permasalahan yang ada di sekitar kita sehingga hampir mustahil masyarakat memiliki jatidiri sebagaimana slogan ‗membangun manusia berkarakter‗ dapat tercapai.
Beberapa studi yang dikendalikan oleh para akademisi, pemerintah, maupun LSM menunjukkan hasil yang mengecewakan. Artinya, budaya literasi masyarakat, khususnya pelajar SLTA terhadap teks sastra masih rendah—masih di bawah standar. Hasil studi menunjukkan bahwa budaya membaca cerpen/novel bagi pelajar SLTA diperoleh rata-rata 0,017% dari 5 buah cerpen/novel yang harus dibaca per tahun. Ironisnya, meskipun telah ditemukan rendahnya budaya literasi tersebut hingga kini belum ada kejelasan tindaklanjutnya. Kesemuanya hanya

FKIP8,Can ‘Reward and Punishment’ Improve Student Motivation?,"Learning activities in the classroom will be effective if students are actively involved and enthusiastic in learning. However, effective learning cannot be implemented due to many factors, such as a lack of student motivation. A lack of motivation has been one of the most frustrating obstacles
to student learning by teachers. This study identifies the effect and role of reward and punishment by teachers in improving student motivation during classroom learning. This study used an experimental method. Two eleven classes were randomly selected as the experimental class and the control
class. This experiment was carried out on Indonesian subjects in a public school in South Lampung,
Indonesia. The learning motivation indicators used in the questionnaire include the desire to succeed, the motivation and need for learning, future hopes and aspirations, rewards in learning, interesting learning activities, and a conducive learning environment. Data were analyzed using the instrument test and Theta correlation coefficient test. The results showed that the implementation of reward and punishment had a positive effect on student motivation. The reward and punishment method engages students to be active in various activities, giving rewards as appreciation and punishment as a trigger not to fail, resulting in increased learning motivation. Teachers can use the findings of the current study as a reference and a way to improve student motivation for effective and meaningful learning.","L1, LB1501, LC5201",European Online Journal of Natural and Social Sciences,2021-03-01,
FKIP7,Teacher and Student Perceptions: Do Students Have Good Reading Motivation?,"Reading requires students’ efforts: they may choose not to do this activity, so motivation has an
important role. Motivation and attitudes toward reading are central to reading performance. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the perceptions of students and teachers on reading motivation at the elementary school level. A quantitative approach with the survey method was employed. The survey was conducted during learning in the Bahasa class. The data were collected from 106 third-grade students and 4 Bahasa teachers in Bandar Lampung, Indonesia, using the Motivations for Reading Questionnaire and Teacher Questionnaire on Student Motivation to Read (3rd Ed.). The data were then analyzed using descriptive and quantitative intercorrelation techniques. It is known that, in general, the students are interested in reading activities where the most influential aspects are
awareness of the importance of reading and competition among students when the teacher gives reading tasks.
Teachers' perceptions regarding the dimensions of reading motivation show that the individual dimension is the most crucial factor to be improved. This factor is directly related to each student's intrinsic motivation, positively correlated with reading achievement. Appropriate environmental conditioning and learning strategies can be carried out to stimulate students' intrinsic motivation in reading, such as carrying out a hands-on activity related to the student's real-life before working on reading tasks. It is implied that the findings of this study can be a reference for teachers to create a teaching system that can foster students' reading interest","L1, LB1501, LC5201",Journal of Hunan University（Natural Sciences）,2021-04-01,

FKIP8,Exploring Teachers' TPCK: Are Indonesian Language Teachers Ready for Online Learning During The Covid-19 Outbreak?,"Online learning decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic have problems in its application. Besides infrastructure, teachers’ ability to integrate technology in learning is also an important factor that affects the success of online learning. In the current online learning, teachers are required to master Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK). Thus, this research aims to explore the Indonesian language teachers’ TPCK and readiness to conduct online learning during the COVID-19 outbreak. This research applied a survey method with 318 participating teachers in Lampung, Indonesia. The data were collected using questionnaires related to attitude, technological knowledge, content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical content
knowledge, technological content knowledge, technological pedagogical knowledge, and technological pedagogical content knowledge. They were then analyzed quantitatively using factor analysis and qualitatively based on the teachers’ answers to learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrate that Indonesian language teachers have adapted to the implementation of online learning related to the use of technology such as the variety of learning media and educational platforms used as well as TPCK skills. In general, teachers’ TPCK tends to be positive about online learning even though some senior teachers have a negative attitude to the technological aspects. They have difficulty using technology in learning so that the class looks monotonous and does not vary. The results of this research can be used as evaluation material by policymakers to improve the learning system.","L1, LB1501, LC5201",Universal Journal of Educational Research,2020-11-01,
FKIP8,THE EFFECT OF PESANTREN EDUCATION ON THE CREATIVITY OF PESANTRENBASED WRITERS,"Many people underestimate learning in pesantren. Muslim students are considered unable to keep up with the times because of the rigidity of the pesantren rules. Meanwhile, literacy learning and literary processing today seems to decrease with the development of modern art. The making of
literary works by a writer is highly influenced by his/her environment. Despite the rigidity of the rules as considered by the people, there are many pesantren-based writers. This study aimed to determine the imagination and creativity of literary texts produced by pesantren-based writers.
Heuristic, hermeneutic, and intertextual reading methods were performed eclectically to analyze the content, values, and language styles in literary texts. Literary texts that become the focus of the study were those written by pesantren-based writers i.e. poems written by Gus Mus, Ahmad Tohari's short
stories, and Habiburrahman El Shirazy's novels. This study found that the imagination and creativity of the literature written by pesantren-based writers tend to be identical with the commitment and quality of the creator's religiosity. It can be implied that the aspects of religiosity and the atmosphere of pesantren that can blow up the imagination and creativity in literary processing can be adopted to support literacy learning and literary processing by public educational institutions outside the pesantren.","L1, LB1501, LC5201",International Journal of Education and Social Science Research,2020,

This study attempts to describe EFL learners’ beliefs about positive and negative effects of translation as a learning strategy by adopting a quantitative approach in which the data were collected by using questionnaires. The findings reveal that Indonesian EFL learners believe translation can help them learn EFL and that despite some potential negative effects, translation will not inhibit their learning. Both beliefs about positive and negative effects of translation simultaneously affect the use of translation as a learning strategy to help EFL learners learn EFL, but the belief about positive effects of translation makes a more significant contribution to it.

Smartphones, and other mobile devices, have been used as a powerful tool in informal contexts of learning since that form of technology can help students engage in out-of-class language learning experiences. However, to our knowledge, no research on EFL learners' predominant language use for their online informal learning activities has been conducted in Indonesian context. Therefore, this study attempted to investigate EFL learners' predominant language use for their online informal learning of English through smartphones, in which the data collected were quantitatively analyzed through descriptive statistics. The results indicate that EFL learners predominantly perform their online informal learning activities in Indonesian, in English, and in both Indonesian and English.

FKIP4,IMPLEMENTATION OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING MODEL TO INCREASE SELFCONFIDENCE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS UNDERSTANDING OF THE ELECTROCHEMISTRY CONCEPT IN CHEMICAL EDUCATION,"Chemistry is one of the scientific disciplines considered difficult for students to understand its microscopic
and macroscopic concepts. Students also claim that this discipline is tedious and complicated. They are unable
to connect what is shown in the visual structure to the process and phenomenon. In the context of self-motivation
among university students, there is a higher chance of expanding the stimulation of learning. This study aimed to
improve self-confidence and the mastery of concepts of chemistry teaching students using problem-based
learning. The quasi-experimental method was used with the design of the non-equivalent pre-test-post-test control
group. The population included all students in the electrochemistry class at Lampung University in 2019. The
purposeful sampling technique employed divided the sample into two groups. The first group was called Class A
and was considered as the experimental class - using problem-based learning -. The second group, Class B, was
recognized as the control class - using the conventional model in which the teacher applied the speech method
in the delivery of materials during the class -. Class A's self-confidence and mastery of concepts have a higher nGain value than class B, and the result of the effect size is that class B has a more significant effect than class A.
Based on the outcome, one can conclude that problem-based learning has a significant influence on improving
self-confidence and mastery of concepts on the electrochemical theme.","L1, LB1501, LC5201",Peri�dico Tch� Qu�mica,,

Balak and Bedu'a dilamban. Nayuh Balak is usually carried out by people who have the title of traditional punyimbang
and people who have a high economic level. Meanwhile, slow bedu'a is carried out by people who do not have
customary balance and people with medium and low economic levels. In the implementation of both nayuh balak and
dilamban bedu'a must use the Sedaduwaian tradition. The obligation to carry out this tradition in every marriage is
inseparable from preserving the Sedaduwaian tradition, as well as delivering moral and ethical messages to those who
carry it out. The Sedaduwaian tradition in the traditional marriage of the Lampung Saibatin Ngambur clan in Pekon
Sukanegara still survives and is preserved now. This is where the role of the younger generation plays a role in
preserving this tradition so that it does not become extinct in the midst of time. The purpose of this paper is to describe
each of the stages and values of the Sedaduwaian tradition in the Lampung Saibatin traditional marriage. Data were
collected through interviews and observations. The results showed that the stages in the Sedaduwaian tradition were

Sebenarnya, bahasa Cirebon atau disebut oleh masyarakat setempat sebagai basa Jawa-Cerbon ialah bahasa yang dituturkan di pesisir utara Jawa Barat, mulai daerah Pedes hingga Cilamaya di Kabupaten Karawang, Blanakan, Pamanukan, Pusakanagara di Kabupaten Subang, Jatibarang di Kabupaten Indramayu sampai Cirebon dan Losari Timur di Kabupaten Brebes Provinsi Jawa Tengah. Pergeseran bahasa (language shift) dapat terjadi karena perpindahan penduduk, ekonomi, atau tingkat pendidikan. Demikian halnya dengan komunitas yang ada di sebuah pulau kecil bernama Pulau Pasaran, Kecamatan Teluk Betung Timur – sebuah kecamatan baru hasil pemekaran dari Kecamatan Teluk Betung Barat yang berpenghuni sekitar 1.163 jiwa, 257 kepala keluarga dan 202 rumah. Masyarakat Pulau pasaran berasal dari berbagai daerah di Jawa, yaitu Gebang, Indramayu, Brebes, Banten, dan Bugis. Bahasa yang digunakan di pulau ini adalah bahasa Cirebon, bahasa Indonesia, bahasa Banten, bahasa Bugis, dan bahasa Lampung. Dengan menggunakan desain penelitian kualitatif-deskriptif, dilakukan penelitian pemeliharaan bahasa Cirebon sebagai bahasa ibu di pulau ini. Data penelitian diperoleh dengan teknik dokumentasi, rekam dan catat, observasi partisipasi, dan teknik wawancara tidak terstruktur. Dari hasil penelitian diketahui bahwa sebagian besar masyarakat Pulau Pasaran (80%) adalah penutur bahasa Cirebon yang dwibahasawan telah mampu memelihara bahasa tersebut sebagai bahasa ibu sejak tahun 1960-an sampai sekarang. Dari generasi pertama sampai generasi ketiga masih tetap menggunakan bahasa Cirebon dalam kehidupan sehari-hari, baik domain keluarga, lingkungan rumah, maupun sekolah. Hal ini dipengaruhi oleh faktor demografi (wilayah yang terpisah dari pemukiman mayoritas masyarakat Lampung dan komunitas yang terkonsentrasi), jumlah penutur yang banyak, sikap bahasa yang positif (bangga dan loyal), serta status sosial ekonomi yang baik. Keempat faktor tersebut menjadikan terpeliharanya bahasa Cirebon di pulau ini yang telah menjadi identitas sosial budaya masyarakat Pulau Pasaran.

keterampilan berbahasa (mendengarkan, berbicara, membaca, dan menulis) dan
aspek kebahasaan (tata bahasa dan kosa kata). Dalam praktik pembelajarannya,
kedua aspek tersebut diajarkan secara terintegrasi. Selain kedua aspek tersebut,
terdapat pula aspek budaya. Isu pembelajaran BIPA saat ini ialah pembelajaran

on students' cognitive understanding than on rote learning. Thus, twenty-first-century students must possess
fundamental skills, one of which is the capacity for critical and creative thinking. However, empirical evidence
suggests that they lack so-called critical and creative thinking (CCT) skills. As a result, educators must
concentrate their efforts on preparing students for future success. Thus, the purpose of this study was to find out
the effect of an inquiry social complexity (ISC)-based student worksheet that would empower students' critical
and creative thinking (CCT) skills to the point where they would be expected to participate actively in learning
activities and achieve the best results. This study employed a one-group pretest-posttest design with numerical
data (quantitative). The results indicated that the average of pre-test, post-test, and n-gain was 0.77 ± 0.06
