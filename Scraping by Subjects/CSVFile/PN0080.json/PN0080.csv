SASTRA SEBAGAI WAHANA MENANAMKAN CINTA LINGKUNGAN","The environment and humans have a very close
relationship. The quality of human life in the future is greatly affected by the quality
of the environment in the present. In fact, the current problem of pollution and
environmental damage in Indonesia is very complex, ranging from waste problems
to forest destruction. The most effective way to deal with these problems is to instill
a sense of love for the environment from an early age. Instilling a sense of love for
the environment at an early age can be started by using literary learning in schools.
One concept of literary learning that can accommodate the cultivation of a sense
of love for the environment is through literary learning patterns based on literary
ecocritics. The concept of literary ecocritics views literature as a picture of human
reality as biological and ecological creatures. The literary ecocritical study model
is broken down into the study of environmental literature and ethical literature.
Environmental literature studies consist of the study of pastoral literary narratives
and apocalyptic literary narratives. The study of ethical literature includes cultural
dimensions and ecological dimensions trying to restore literature to its original
place of life. The following article proves that the concept of literary ecocritics is
very influential in the process of instilling a sense of environmental love in students
ranging from elementary, junior high, and high school / vocational school levels.
