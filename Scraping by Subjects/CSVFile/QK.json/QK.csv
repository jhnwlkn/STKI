FMIPA2,"Molecular Characterization of Odontoglossum Ringspot Virus
(ORSV) in Java and Bali, Indonesia","Orchids are one of the important ornamental plants that were cultivated in tropical countries, including in Indonesia. Virus infections has
been important limiting factor in orchids cultivation because it could decrease the orchids quality. Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV)
is one of the most reported viruses infecting orchids, which spread widely in the world. During 2010-2011 surveys of viral diseases were
conducted in Jawa and Bali, Indonesia. The orchids were found infected by virus, showed symptoms of mosaic, mottle, chlorotic, necrotic,
streak, wilting leaf and ringspot on leaf surface. Detection with Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) showed that
only 5 from 88 samples were infected by ORSV with total incidence of 5.7%. Three leaf samples of Phalaenopsis sp., were infected, then
called ORSV BOC, ORSV KRB and ORSV TNBB isolates, respectively. The results obtained by amplification of DNA band with 474 bp in length
as expression of Coat Protein (CP) gene. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of CP gene showed that ORSV BOC have
similarity to ORSV Germany, whereas, ORSV KRB and ORSV TNBB lead to speciation that possibly to be a new strain. This study was proved
that ORSV have entered and spread widely by infected orchids in orchids landscape (nursery), semi-natural forests (botanical gardens)
and natural forest (national park) in Java and Bali, Indonesia.","QK, S1",Asian Journal of Plant Pathology,2016-03-15,

Exposure of 0.2 mT magnetic field to tomato seeds is known to increase germination, growth, as well as resistance of plants to Fusarium sp. In this study F1 tomato seeds obtained from parental plants whose seeds were induced by 0.2 mT magnetic field and Fusarium sp. were tested for germination and growth after reinfection with Fusarium oxysporum f.sp lycopersicui (Fol).  

The study was arranged factorially in Completely Randomized Design (RAL). The first factor is a seed type consisting of 8 types: M0F0, M0F60, M7F0, M7F60, M11F0, M11F60, M15F0, and M15F60.  T.he numbers 0, 7, 11, 15 after M and 0 and 60 after F indicate that the seeds obtained from tomato plants induced by 0.2 mT of magnetic fields for each 0, 7, 11, and 15 minutes are then infected by monosporal suspensions of Fusarium sp. respectively each for 0 and 60 minutes. The second factor is Fol infection for 0  (A) and 60 minutes (B). The parameters observed were germination rate, germination percentage, and dry weight of plant. The data obtained were analyzed using Anova and further tested by Fisher's Test at α = 5%.

The results of the variance analysis show that the tomatoes induced by 0.2 mT magnetic field produce seeds that have a higher vigor than the control (seeds without magnetic field induction) although infected by Fol. The nature is the same as the nature of the parental seed.  These results suggest that the vigor properties of the F1 tomato seeds are the same as the vigor properties of the parental seeds induced by magnetic fields.

FMIPA2,Study of Orchid Resistance Induced by Ceratorhiza sp. Against ORSV Infection Based on Peroxidase Activity,"Orchid is one of the popular ornamental plants that widely grown in Indonesia. However, the process of orchid cultivation is often hampered by virus infections. The virus that often infects the orchids is Odontoglossum ringspot virus. Viruses that enter orchid cells and replicate will activate the orchid’s defense response. This defense response is characterized by the increase of peroxidase activity. The peroxidase enzyme works in the formation of lignin to thicken cell walls and prevent viruses from entering other cells. In addition, the orchid defense response can also be activated through induced systemic resistance by inoculation of Ceratorhiza sp. as endophytic mycorrhizae. In this study, Factorial Complete Randomized Design (CRD) was used with 2 factors. Factor 1 is the type of orchid (Phalaenopsis amabilis and Dendrobium discolor) and factor 2 is the type of treatment (inoculation of mycorrhizae, virus, and mycorrhizae-virus). The orchid’s resistance level is determined by the analysis results of peroxidase activity using spectrophotometer. The results obtained indicate that all treatment combinations strongly influence the increase of peroxidase activity. Peroxidase activity of Phalaenopsis amabilis is 1.42 [(Umg) / min] and Dendrobium discolor is 1.64 [(Umg) / min] in average. Peroxidase activity on Dendrobium discolor was higher than on Phalaenopsis amabilis. This indicates that Dendrobium discolor has a higher level of resistance when compared to Phalaenopsis amabilis.

FMIPA2,KORESPONDENSI : Efek Induksi Rhizoctonia pada Ketebalan Daun Anggrek yang diinfeksi Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV),"Anggrek memiliki nilai ekonomis yang tinggi sehingga sangat potensial untuk
dibudidayakan. Jenis yang paling banyak diminati masyarakat adalah Dendrobium dan
Phalaenopsis. Namun terdapat kendala utama yang dapat memengaruhi pertumbuhan
anggrek yaitu infeksi virus. Jenis virus yang dilaporkan paling banyak menginfeksi adalah
Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV). Infeksi virus ini dapat menghambat pertumbuhan
dan ketahanan tanaman, menurunkan kualitas bunga dan nilai estetika serta daya jual.
Didapati pula gejala infeksi virus berupa mosaik, klorotik, streak, dan nekrosis. Salah satu
upaya untuk mengatasi infeksi virus adalah dengan memanfaatkan mikoriza. Mikoriza yang
dapat digunakan yaitu Rhizoctonia sp. Asosiasi mikoriza pada tumbuhan anggrek dapat
memberikan pengaruh positif pada penyerapan nutrisi dan pertumbuhan inangnya,
sehingga diharapkan dapat melindungi anggrek dari infeksi virus. Tujuan penelitian ini
untuk mengetahui efek induksi Rhizoctonia pada karakter anatomi daun Phalaenopsis
amabilis dan Dendrobium discolor yang diinfeksi ORSV dan mengetahui apakah terdapat
perbedaan anatomi diantara kedua anggrek tersebut. Penelitian dilakukan di Laboratorium

FP5,DNA Barcoding Orchidaceae di Kebun Raya,"Kebun Raya Liwa merupakan lembaga yang melakukan konservasi ex-situ tumbuhan, termasuk Orchidaceae. Banyak koleksi dari famili Orchidaceae telah dikumpulkan dari habitat aslinya namun belum teridentifikasi. Urgensi penelitian ini adalah memberikan identifikasi spesies melalui keterbatasan spesimen di lapangan, khususnya organ bunga. Penelitian ini menerapkan pendekatan DNA Barcoding dalam mengidentifikasi koleksi famili Orchidaceae Kebun Raya Liwa untuk melengkapi identifikasi manual. Analisis variasi sekuens dan identifikasi barcode DNA untuk Orchidaceae dilakukan dengan menggunakan daerah gen barcode standar yang direkomendasikan yaitu gen rbcL. Amplifikasi gen dilakukan dengan menggunakan pasangan primer tunggal untuk setiap gen yang menghasilkan ukuran sekuens rata-rata 585 bp. Hasil identifikasi molekuler menggunakan BLAST-n menunjukkan bahwa kecocokan tertinggi antara identifikasi morfologi dan molekuler adalah pada tingkat spesies, dengan nilai identitas berkisar antara 99,15% hingga 99,65%. Nilai identitas yang tinggi menunjukkan kecocokan urutan nukleotida yang tinggi. Penjajaran sekuen menggunakan BLASTn menunjukkan bahwa LW1, LW2, LW3, LW5, dan LW6 memiliki kemiripan yang tinggi, serupa dengan hasil identifikasi morfologi untuk Agrostophyllum majus, Bulbophyllum granulosum, Dendrobium agregatum, Eria cristata, dan Podochillus cultratus.

FP5,Invasiveness Identification: A Study Case from Lantana,"Invasion by invasive species represents one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide, causing degradation and loss of habitat. Among them, one species belonged to the Verbenaceae family, namely Lantana camara, which includes 100 of the world’s worst invasive species. Distinguishing invasive from non-invasive species based on morphology alone is often difficult for plants in a vegetative stage, especially in Lantana, where they have complex morphological characters. In this regard, DNA barcoding may become a good alternative. This study aimed to select and provide a DNA barcode region that capable of distinguishing the invasive and non-invasive Lantana. Four DNA Barcode markers available in the sequence database (NCBI and BOLD), namely matK, rbcL, psba-trnh, and ITS2, were used to identify the invasiveness of various Lantana. A total of 132 data sequences from 17 species of Lantana were collected. The sequences were aligned and constructed into a dendrogram using MEGA X through the Neighbor-Joining method. This study shows that it is possible to distinguish Lantana camara from a series of closely related congeners by plastid base gene (matk and rbcl). The constructed phylogeny tree shows that invasive species Lantana camara was in a different clade with non-invasive Lantana.",QK,Jurnal Silva Tropika,2021-12-31,

Masyarakatnya  memiliki  mata  pencaharian  60%  bertani  dan  berternak.  Jenis  usaha  yang  mereka lakukan ini sangat prospek untuk ditingkatkan, karena potensi air dari dataran tinggi sangat bagus. Hasil pengolahan data resistiviti menunjukkan bahwa titik pengukuran terdiri dari 5 lapisan tanah dan batuan. Dari identifikasi kelima lapisan dapat dikatakan bahwa pada titik pengukuran tersebut tidak ditemukan keberadaan akuifer air tanah. Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa kedalaman air tanah di Desa Batu Keramat sebelah barat berada pada kedalaman yang  sangat  dalam,  yang  di  atasnya  terdapat  batuan  yang  keras  sehingga  tidak  mungkin  untuk  dibuat  sumur  gali. Solusinya membuat sumur bor dengan biaya yang sangat mahal dan sangat sulit untuk dilakukan. Jalan satu-satunya untuk  mendapatkan  air  yaitu  dari  dataran  tinggi  air  pegunungan.  Oleh  karena  itu  tim  Pengabdian  Unila  mengajak masyarakat  Batu  Keramat  khususnya  Mitra  (H.

Plantain is a fruit commodity that has a high level of market demand, but the yield is low. 
To overcome this problem, tissue culture techniques are used to increase plantlet 
production in a short time. Plantain have parthenocarpy character, high sterility, and 
different levels of ploidy. Tissue culture with the addition of flame lily tuber biomutagen 
containing colchicine was used as a strategy to overcome the above constraints because it 
was thought to increase the production of polyploid banana plantlets. Changes in the 
anatomical and morphological structures are indicators of polyploidy. The purpose of this 
study was to obtain information on changes in the anatomical and morphological 
structures of plantain leaves as a result of giving in vitro plantlet propagation media as an 
indicator of the formation of polyploidy. Plantlets were grown on tissue culture media 
supplemented with three treatments: 10% flame lily tuber extract, 0.1% pure colchicine, 
and without addition (control). The parameters observed were epidermal cell size, 
stomata size, stomata index, number and leaf area. Epidermal cell size, stomata size and 
stomatal index were analyzed using range values and mean values. The number of leaves, 
and the average wide of leaf, is then shown in the form of a bar chart. The results showed

FMIPA2,INDUCTION OF POLYPLOID BANANA KEPOK THROUGH IN VITRO ADDITION OF FLAME LILY EXTRACT,"Flame  lily  (Gloriosa  superba L.)  contains  colchicine  and  gloriosinin  almost  all  parts  of  the plant,  especially  in  tubers  and  seeds.  Colchicine  is  often  used  in  biological  and  breeding studies to induce mutations that result in polyploid plants. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of flame lily tuber extract asa natural mutagen for the development of superior kepok banana cultivars through the in vitroassembly of polyploid kapok bananas. The study was  arranged  completely  randomly  with  two  factors.  Factor 1  consisted of  3 levels,  namely fresh  extract  of  breech flower  tubers  (10  %),  pure  colchicine  solution  (0.1%)  as  a  positive control,  and  without  being  added  (0%)  as  a  negative  control.  Factor  2  consists  of  3  levels, namely Kepok Abu, Kepok Batu and Kepok Kuning. All treatment combinations were repeated 5 times.The data were analyzed by Diversity Test (Sidik Ragam) and if there is a difference, it  will  be  continued  with  the  DMRT  test  at  a  level  of  5%.  The  results  showed  that  the administration of colchicine in culture media could induce the emergence of polyploid banana plantlets  when  viewed  from  the  addition  of  the  size  of  the  number  of  shoots,  shoot  length, number  of  roots,  root  length,  leaf  area,  epidermal  cells,  stomata,  and  decreased  stomata index. Meanwhile, 10% breech flower tuber extract was not able to induce the emergence of polyploid plantlets. Kepok  Kuningbananas had  a better  response  to  mutagens  than Kepok Abu andKepok Batu. From these results, it can be concluded that 0.1% colchicine was able to  induce  polyploid  banana  plantlets  and  10%  breech  flower  tuber  extract  was  not  able  to induce polyploid plantlets.Keywords:colchicine, flame lily, kapok banana.",QK,Jurnal Ilmiah Biologi Eksperimen dan Keanekaragaman Hayati,,

WITH SORGUM (Sorghum bicolor) MEDIA AND ITS EFFECT ON THE QUALITY OF BAMBOO LEAF COMPOST (Bambusa sp.),"Bamboo is a type of plant that grows in Indonesia. So far, people only use the stems and throw away the leaves. As a result, these abundant bamboo leaves become waste. Bamboo leaf waste contains lignin content of 19.8-26.6%, and becomes compost in the long term. The process of composting bamboo leaf litter can be accelerated using an activator such as the inoculum fungi Geotrichum sp. which is ligninolytic so that it can break down lignin complex compounds contained in bamboo leaf waste into simpler compounds. Sorghum contains about 6.5-7.9% fiber. The high fiber content in sorghum seeds can be used as a growth medium for fungal inoculum. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of sorghum as an inoculum medium for Geotrichum sp. and the effect of inoculum on compost quality. This research was carried out in August - December 2019 at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Biology Department, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Unila. This study used a completely randomized design (CRD) method with 4 treatments, namely Control (Bamboo leaf litter), P1 (Bamboo leaf litter + 1% inoculum), P2 (Bamboo leaf litter + 1.5 % inoculum) and P3 (Bamboo leaf litter). + 2% inoculum) each treatment was repeated 3 times. The variables observed were the number of spores and spore viability using the Colony Forming Unit (CFU) calculation on inoculum and compost. Analysis of the content of C, N, P, and C/N ratio was carried out to determine the quality of the compost. Based on the research results, sorghum can be used as a growth medium for the ligninolytic fungi inoculum Geotrichum sp. with spore viability of 74.18% and the addition of 1.5% inoculum (P2) gave the best results on the quality of bamboo leaf compost (Bambusa sp.)",QK,Jurnal Ilmiah Biologi Eksperimen dan Keanekaragaman Hayati (J-BEKH),2021,

Autoecology of Ceratium furca and Chaetoceros didymus as potential harmful algal blooms in tourism and aquaculture sites at Teluk Pandan Bay, Lampung, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 56705680. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) phenomenon has been observed around tourism and aquaculture sites in Teluk Pandan Waters, Lampung Bay. The dominant potential HABs found in Teluk Pandan waters were Ceratium furca and Chaetoceros didymus. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between the environmental physicochemical factors and the abundance of C. furca and C. didymus as potential HABs. Phytoplankton samples were collected from four stations (Hurun Bay, Sidodadi Coastal Waters, Sari Ringgung Beach and Cikunyinyi Bay) during May-August 2022. Physical parameters (temperature, depth, brightness, current velocity and salinity), as well as chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, pH, phosphate, nitrite, nitrate and ammonia) were all measured in conjunction with phytoplankton sampling. Canonical correlation analysis and multiple regression were used to predict the effect of environmental parameters on phytoplankton density. Blooms of C. furca were found with the highest density at 5.417×106 cells/L in Cikunyiyi Bay, while C. didymus predominated in Hurun Bay (2.890×104 cells/L), Sidodadi Coastal Waters (3.923×104 cells/L) and Sari Ringgung Beach (3.531×104 cells/L). The main factors influencing the increase in C. furca population at Cikunyinyi Bay were pH, phosphate and nitrate. The increase in C. didymus population at Sidodadi Coastal Waters was affected by phosphate, nitrate and nitrite, while phosphate and nitrate influenced the increase in C. didymus population at Sari Ringgung Beach. Potentially HABs density was found to be higher near intensive shrimp farming sites. The use of fertilizer and artificial feed in high quantities is thought to be responsible for increased water eutrophication. Periodic monitoring and consistent determination of environmental carrying capacity for intensive shrimp farming activities are required to control HABs and ensure the sustainability of aquaculture and tourism activities in Teluk Pandan Waters.","QK, SH",,2022-11-26,

The need for sugar is continuously increasing as the population grows and the diverse demands of industrial needs. One of the efforts to increase sugar production is by developing high-yielding sugarcane varieties. In doing so, performing morphological characterization is necessary so that superior sugarcane cultivars can be identified. This study aimed to determine the morphological variations and phenetic relationships of the crosses of sugarcane cultivars of the collections of PT. Gunung Madu Plantation in Lampung, Indonesia. Morphological observation of 15 sugarcane cultivars was carried out on 37 characters covering leaves, leaf midrib, internodes, stems, eyes, and agronomical aspects. The dendrogram was built using the UPGMA cluster using the Gower’s General Similarity Coefficient algorithm, while the PCA analysis was performed using the Euclidean Distance algorithm using MVSP v.3.1 software. The results of the study showed that there were fairly high morphological variations among the sugarcane cultivars observed. The results showed the superior sugarcane cultivars of PT. GMP collections (i.e., GMP 1, GMP 2, GMP 3, GMP 4, GMP 5, GMP 6, and GMP 7) were not in one cluster due to differences between each parent. The principal component analysis of 37 characters showed that the total variation on axis I contributed 27.62% to the variation with an eigenvalue of 0.25, while axis II was 17.9% with an eigenvalue of 0.16. The information about morphological variations in this study suggests that morphological characters as taxonomic evidence are very good for identifying and analyzing local sugarcane cultivar variations and knowing the closeness of their kinship relationships.",QK,BIODIVERSITAS,2022-08,

This  research  arranged  using  Completely  Randomized  Design (CRD)  with  the  combination  between  0,2  mT  magnetic  field  induction  and Foxinfection consist of: control (M0); 0,2 mT magnetic field induction for 7 minutes and 48 seconds (M7); and  15  minutes  and  36  minutes  (M15);  as  well  as  seed  infection  with Fusarium  oxysporumthat consist of control without infection (F0) and infected for 60 minutes (F60). Each test unit repeated  5  times.  Acquired  data  then  analyzed  using  Analysis  of  variance  with  α  5%. Analysis result shows that 0,2 mT magnetic field induction for 7 minutes and 48 seconds on the seed is more effective than induction for 15 minutes and 36 seconds. Induction using 0,2 mT magnetic field for 7 minutes and 48 seconds produced plants with better sprouting in the early  growth,  and  higher  dry  mass  and  chlorophyl content,  peroxidase  activity,  and  lignin thickness in plants both infected and uninfected with fox. With the increase in the sprouting of  red  chili  plants,  it  can  be  indicated  that  red  chili  plants  have  high  resistance  to  Fox infection.Keywords:chili (Capsicum annuumL.), Fusarium oxysporum, Magnetic field",QK,Jurnal Ilmiah Biologi Eksperimen dan Keanekaragaman Hayati,,

This study aims to determine the identification of Dendrobium based on the anatomical characters of leaf stomata in Liwa Botanical Garden. Four Dendrobium accessions were collected, namely CAT140, CAT 144, CAT 274, and IR015. The results of the observation of nine anatomical characters on the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves indicate that the leaf organs have high variations. Accessions IR015, CAT 140, and CAT 274 have stomata only on the lower surface, while CAT 144 has stomata on the upper and lower surfaces. This difference is due to the position of the leaves attached to the stem. CAT 144 forming an angle of 45°C, while the others open horizontally. In case of IR015, CAT 140, and CAT 274, the upper surface of the leaves is only composed of epidermis which is composed of cells which are irregular and pentagonal in shape. The highest number was in CAT 274 because the epidermal cells was smaller than IR015 and CAT 144. The types of stomata in all types were the same, namely tetracytic in the form of stomata surrounded by 4 neighboring cells.

Phylogenetics provides facilities in the fields of human epidemiology,
ecology, and evolutionary biology. In evolutionary science, this field of
science is used to integrate spatial data in detecting the journey of living
things over time. In health biology, the development of this science is also
used to detect the spread of disease/pathogens from a region to the global
direction. Phylogenetic analysis is able to describe the origin of the disease,
the pattern of distribution, and speciation. In the pandemic analysis, several
diseases that have been analyzed are the Chikungunya virus outbreak in
2007, Ebola and H3N2 influenza virus in 2014, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus
in 2020. The study results reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has three
variants of lineage groups, namely types A, B, and C. The Covid-19 virus
type A was first discovered in Wuhan City, China. Meanwhile, the type A
virus mutation is seen in the United States and most of these viruses have
also been found in corona positive patients from Australia. The Covid-19
type B virus was detected in patients living in East Asia, while the Covid-19

FMIPA2,"SECONDARY METABOLITE ANALYSIS OF ORCHID MYCORRHIZA ANTAGONIST TEST RESULTS
AGAINST ORSV","Moth orchid (Phalaenopsis amabilis L. (Blume)) is a native orchid originating from Indonesia.
Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) is an important type of orchid virus and distribution area
in the world, including in Indonesia. Efforts to control the spread of this disease can be done by
using endurance induced mycorrhiza orchids. Several studies have shown that induced endurance
can reduce the replication of ORSV, but so far no studies related to secondary metabolism
analysis have been produced. Phenol is known for its secondary metabolite composition and
exudate bioactivity in inducing orchid orchid microbial resistance to pathogens. In this study, the
mycorrhiza orchid used was Ceratorhiza sp. while the ORSV isolate used inoculum from
Magelang. The orchid resistance of orchids caused by ORSV infection in Moth orchid indicates
an increase in phenolic compounds in virus-infested leaves. The highest phenol content occurred
in the treatment of mycorrhiza-inoculated treatment along with viruses, namely: MV, and VM,
ranging between 0.097059 ppm and 0.087059 ppm, respectively. The highest concentrations of
phenol were at single viral inoculation (V) and mycorrhizal (M), 0.054706 ppm and 0.037647
ppm, respectively. The lowest phenol content in plantlets not caused by mycorrhiza or inoculated
virus (control) is 0.020588 ppm. These data explain that in the absence of the first mycorrhiza
inoculation, the increase in total phenol content is not too high compared to viral inoculation
prior to mycorrhizal inoculation. This proves that an increase in the concentration of total
phenolic compounds in plantlets can increase if the plant is infected with pathogens.",QK,,2021-10-30,

FMIPA2,Study of Resistance on Orchids Induced Rhizoctonia to ORSV Based on Secondary Metabolite Analysis,"Dendrobium discolor and Phalaenopsis amabilis are in high demand because of their beautiful shape, color, texture, and flower arrangement. The current obstacle to orchid cultivation is infection with Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV). One of the efficient ways to control the infection of this pathogen and does not cause an impact on the environment is to use Rhizoctonia mycorrhizae. Mycorrhizal relationship with plants will form induced resistance. Plants resulting from induced resistance will induce secondary metabolite, namely peroxidase enzymes. This type of secondary metabolites will prevent the growth and development of pathogens and plants become resistant to pathogenic infections. The purpose of this study was to determine differences in peroxidase enzyme activity and differences in resistance to P. amabilis and D. discolor after Rhizoctonia induction against ORSV infection. This research was carried out in several stages, namely plantlet preparation, mycorrhizal inoculation, mycorrhizal inoculation, and peroxidase enzyme activity analysis using a UV Vis spectrometer at a wavelength of 420 nm. The results showed that D. discolor had a higher peroxidase enzyme activity than P. amabilis. In the treatment application factor, the peroxidase enzyme activity was the highest in the Mycorrhizal Virus treatment compared to the Mycorrhizal and Virus treatments. This study showed that D. discolor was more resistant to ORSV infection than P. amabilis. and the application of Mycorrhizae proved to be successful in increasing the activity of the peroxidase enzyme as a response to plant protection against viral infections.",QK,TECHNO: JURNAL PENELITIAN,2022-10-30,

This virus has entered and infected orchids in Indonesia, both natural orchids and hybrid orchid. Detection result indicates that the virus is found in various locations of natural forests, botanical gardens, and nurseries in Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and Papua. 
Result showed that hybrid orchids in nurseries were more susceptible to ORSV infection compared to natural orchids in natural forests and botanical gardens. ORSV was found to infect hybrid orchids in eight nurseries, compared to natural orchids in natural forests and botanical gardens, each of which was found in only 3 location. The DAS-ELISA serological test showed higher mean value of absorbance in samples collected from hybrid orchids at nurseries (1.125-1.152), compared to samples collected from natural orchids in botanical gardens and natural forests (0.520-0.918 and 0.520, respectively). Phalaenopsis was the most suitable and the most vulnerable host to be infected with ORSV (incidence rate at 57%), followed by Calanthe (14%), Dendrobium (9%), and Bulbophylum, Cattleya, Oncidium, and Liparis with incidence rate at 5%. Sequence analysis of coat protein genes showed that Indonesian ORSV isolates from natural forests and botanical gardens had higher similarity index value with isolates from other countries (100%), compared with Indonesian ORSV isolates from nurseries (99.3%). ORSV isolates from natural forests and botanical gardens had fewer mutation rate of 18% and 36%, compared to ORSV isolates from nurseries with mutation rate of 45%.

Orchid cultivation has several problems, one of which is infection with Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV). Rhizoctonia can be used in the induction of orchid resistance by triggering lignification in roots and leaves. However, there is little information about the induction of mycorrhizal resistance. It is necessary to study to determine of orchids resistance to virus through analysis of anatomical character on root and leave. Materials and Methods: Factorial block random design. The factor I: Orchids types: P. amabilis (A1) dan D. discolor (A2). Factor II: Inoculation treatment: Control (K), Mycorrhiza (M), Virus (V) and Mycorrhiza-Virus (MV). Parameters observed were root anatomical structure includes lignification and the presence of peloton and leaf anatomical structure includes leaf damage and thickness. Results: All types of experimental plants experienced root and leaf tissue damage due to virus inoculation and mycorrhiza. The anatomy of the treated roots had differences in the thickness of the epidermal lignin and the thickness of the carrier bundle lignin. Meanwhile, changes in the anatomical character of leaves as a result of virus inoculation showed damage to the epidermis and stomata tissue. Conclusion: Based on the anatomical observations of roots and leaves, D. discolor was more resistant to ORSV infection than P. amabilis.

FMIPA2,Variation of response induced by ceratorhiza on Dendrobium discolor and Phalaenopsis amabilis to odontoglossum ringspot virus infection based on disease intensity and plant resistance level,"he popular cultivated orchid is Phalaenopsis sp. and Dendrobium sp. Mycorrhizae are very important for orchid plants to complete their life cycle. Mycorrhizae are capable of symbiosis with the root system of the host plant which can increase the absorption of these elements. The purpose of this study was to find out the symptoms of infection, the intensity of infectious diseases, the level of resistance to infection. The method used in this study was completely randomized design (CRD) with 2 factors and 4 iterations, the first factor was the type of orchid used Phalaenopsis amabilis (A1) and Dendrobium discolor (A2), and the second factor was the type of administration of mycorrhizal., Virus , and mycorrhizal virus. Observation of the symptoms of the disease is done by looking at the symptoms that appear on the leaves that have been infected with ORSV, while to determine the intensity of the disease and the level of resistance can use a predetermined formula. The results showed that the disease intensity in Phalaenopsis amabilis was more severe than in Dendrobium discolor, which was 40% on each leaf. The level of resistance in Dendrobium discolor is more resistant than Phalaenopsis amabilis, this indicates that Dendrobium discolor on average has a tolerant response. Ceratorhiza could not suppress the intensity of the disease, because from the results obtained, treatment of orchids inoculated with mycorrhiza and virus showed more severe symptoms than treatment only inoculated with virus. Ceratorhiza was unable to increase the resistance of Phalaenopsis amabilis and Dendrobium discolor, this was because treatment of orchids inoculated with mycorrhiza and virus showed a very simple response compared to treatmentonly inoculated with virus.

Anggrek populer dibudidayakan adalah Phalaenopsis sp. dan Dendrobium sp. Mikoriza sangat penting bagi tanaman anggrek untuk melengkapi siklus hidupnya. Mikoriza  mampu bersimbiosis dengan sistem akar tanaman inang yang dapat meningkatkan daya serap unsur tersebut. Tujuan penelitian untuk mengetahui gejala infeksi, intensitas penyakit menular, tingkat resistensi terhadap infeksi. Metode penelitian: Rancangan Acak Lengkap (RAL) dengan 2 faktor dan 4 iterasi, faktor pertama adalah jenis anggrek yang digunakan Phalaenopsis amabilis (A1) dan Dendrobium discolor (A2), dan faktor kedua adalah jenis pemberian mikoriza, virus, dan virus mikoriza. Pengamatan gejala penyakit dilakukan dengan melihat gejala yang muncul pada daun yang telah terinfeksi ORSV. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan intensitas penyakit pada Phalaenopsis amabilis lebih parah dibandingkan dengan Dendrobium discolor yaitu 40% pada setiap daun. Tingkat ketahanan pada Dendrobium discolor lebih tahan dibandingkan Phalaenopsis amabilis. Dendrobium discolor memiliki respon yang toleran. Ceratorhiza tidak dapat menekan intensitas penyakit. Pengobatan  anggrek yang diinokulasi dengan mikoriza dan virus menunjukkan gejala yang lebih parah daripada pengobatan yang hanya diinokulasi virus. Ceratorhiza tidak mampu meningkatkan ketahanan terhadap Phalaenopsis amabilis dan Dendrobium discolor, hal ini dikarenakan perlakuan anggrek yang diinokulasi mikoriza dan virus menunjukkan respon yang sangat sederhana dibandingkan dengan perlakuan yang hanya diinokulasi virus.",QK,Bioscience,2022-06-31,

FMIPA2,Abiotic Factors Influencing Mantangan (Merremia peltata)  Invasion In Bukit Barisan Selatan  National Park,"Some areas in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park have serious problems related to Merremia peltata (Family Convolvulaceae) invasion. The abiotic factors influencing M. peltata invasion were investigated in this study. This research compared abiotic factors in three forest locations with different invasion levels i.e. severe, moderate and mild invasions. Abiotic factors measured were percentage of tree canopy coverage, micro climate factors (temperature and humidity), elevation above sea level and physical and chemical properties of the soil surface. In this study, canopy coverage is classified as abiotic factors because it influences the intensity of light that can reach the forest floor. A post-hoc Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) was employed to determine significant differences (p<0.05) among abiotic factors. In addition, a test of correlation and multiple linear regression were conducted to determine the relationships between abiotic factors and M. peltata invasion. Multiple regression testing  showed that canopy coverage significantly (p<0.05)  influenced M. peltata invasion. Based on the generated model, a 1% addition of canopy coverage would decrease M. peltata invasion by 2.8%. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to predict the relationship between soil nutrients and invasion. The t C/N ratio and P2O5, Ca, Mg and Na concentration significantly (p<0.05) influenced invasion level. Again, based on the generated model, the increase in the C/N ratio as well as P2O5 and Ca concentrations were correlated with the reduce of M. peltata invasion; while the increase of Mg and Na concentrations were correlated with the increase of M. peltata invasion. M. peltata invasion in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park was influenced by opened forest canopy  and was correlated with high concentration of  Na and Mg in the soil of the invaded forest areas.","Q1, QK, SD",Abiotic Factors Influencing Mantangan (Merremia peltata)  Invasion In Bukit Barisan Selatan  National Park,2015,

Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.) is a tropical and subtropical annual shrub from the Euphorbiaceae tribe. Tuber is widely known as a staple food-producing carbohydrates and leaves as a vegetable. Indonesia is the second largest country producing Cassava after Nigeria with an average of five years' total supply of 9.67 million tons or 10.61% of the total supply of world cassava. Central Cassava land in Indonesia is controlled by Lampung Province with cassava production in Lampung Province reaching 8.33 million tons in 2013. This situation makes Lampung a supplier of one-third of the national Cassava production from national production of 23.92 million tons. However, there are still many production constraints in Cassava cultivation, including Fusarium wilt. This disease is caused by the Fusarium oxysporum fungus, which until now still cannot be treated effectively. The use of Cassava cultivars that are resistant to fusarium wilt with high yields is expected to be an important disease control alternative. This study aims to determine and determine the specific expression character of Fo-resistant Cassava plantlets, which are phenol content. The Cassava Planlet has been initiated and selected in vitro in the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with the addition of fusaric acid (FA) at a concentration of 0 ppm (control), 20 ppm, 40 ppm, 60 ppm and 80 ppm. The purpose of this study was to determine the phenol content after being induced by fusaric acid and inoculated by Fusarium oxysporum. The results showed that in vitro, the concentration range of fusaric acid tolerant for selection of Cassava plantlets with optimum growth was between 20 ppm - 80 ppm; the higher the concentration of FA, the higher the phenol content of the Cassava plantlets.

FP25,PENGARUH DURASI FUMIGASI PRASIMPAN DENGAN FOSFIN PADA VIABILITAS BENIH SORGUM (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) SELAMA PENYIMPANAN,"During storage, the seeds experienced deterioration by time and or by pests. Sorghum
seed is very susceptible to pest attacks in warehouse. In addition to prevent pest attacks,
seed fumigation before storage can also give negative effects on seed viability. This study
aimed to determine the effect of duration of fumigation with phosphine (PH3) on the
viability of sorghum seeds during storage. This experiment was conducted at the
Laboratory of Seeds and Plant Breeding, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Lampung
from July 2016 to April 2017. Two factors consisted duration of fumigation and storage
length those were arranged factorially and then it were applied in a randomized complete
block design (RCBD). This experiment was conducted three replicates. Sorghum seeds
that have been given treatment duration of fumigation of 24, 48, and 72 hours were
wrapped in tight sealed plastic bags and placed in a storage room with a temperature of
26 ± 0.4°C. Viability of the seeds was then observed after 3, 6, and 9 months storage.
The significant interaction effect of duration of fumigation and storage length on viability
of sorghum seed showed that the effect of duration of fumigation was depended on
storage length applied to the seeds. It was showed by variables of electrical conductivity,
speed of germination, and germination capacity. The viability of the seed exposed to
duration of fumigation 24 or 48 hours would not decrease significantly up to 9 months of
storage. Whereas, viability of the seed exposed to duration or fumigation for 72 hours
would decreased their viability after 6 months of storage. Effect of duration of fumigation
on viability seemed earlier by the speed of germination than by germination capacity.","QK, S1",Prosiding Perhimpunan Pemuliaan Indonesia (PERIPI) Komda Sumatera Barat,2018-10-04,

This study examines the influence of MF on the growth of tomato infected by Fusarium oxysporum, fungal pathogen that causes Fusarium wilt in tomatoes. This factorial study arranged in a stripe split plot design. Factors tested consists of long exposure to the MF, M (control; 7'48 ""; II'42"" and 15'36 ""), how to infect fusarium, F (through soaking the seeds and by infecting fusarium through the stem at the age 28 days after sowing (das), and soaking the seeds, S (soaking and without soaking for 15 minutes before MF treatment). Each unit of experiment was repeated 3 times. Parameters measured were percentage of germination, growth rate based on plant height, and fresh weight. Observations were made on the plant until 42 das. Data were analyzed of variance followed by the least significant difference (LSD) test at α = 1 and 5%. The results showed that the interaction between MF and fusarium (MxF), fusarium and soaking (FxS), and MF, fusarium, and soaking (MxFxS) did not produce a different response on all parameters measured. Differences in response to the treatments derived from the treatment of MF (M), Fusarium (F), and the treatment interaction of the MF x soaking (MxS).

Magnetic fields are proven to be able to improve the growth quality of various plants. This study was examined whether the treatment of magnetic fields on chili seeds (Capsicum annuum L) infected by Fusarium sp. can maintain plant growth until the generative phase. This study is a two-factor study using a randomized block design. The first factor was 0.2 mT magnetic field induction treatment consisting of 7 minutes 48 seconds (M7), 15 minutes 36 seconds (M15) and without magnetic treatment (M0) as control and the second factor was the treatment of the Fusarium oxysporum  infection for  60 minutes (F60) and not infected (F0). Each treatment unit was repeated 5 times. Data obtained were analyzed for variance at α = 5%.  The results of the analysis showed that the treatment in this study did not give a significant difference in carbohydrate content, flowering rate and flower amount, and fruiting rate from plants infected with Fusarium sp. (M0F60, M7, F60, and M15F60) with plants from seeds that were not infested Fusarium sp. (M0F0, M7, F0, and M15F0). Thus the treatment of magnetic fields can cause plants to be resistant to Fusarium sp. infection, so that the plants from the seeds infected with the Fusarium sp are able to flower and bear fruit at the same rate and produce the same amount of flower.

DETERMINED THROUGH GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY","Iron (Fe) toxicity is a significant abiotic stress in swamp land. The study aimed to identify the candidate loci related to Fe toxicity tolerance through Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) approach. The study used 242 rice accessions consisting of 192 breeding lines and
50 local landraces, and custom-designed 384 rice SNPs-chips. A field evaluation was conducted in inland swamp for two season periods (2014 and 2015). Phenotypic data and association mapping were analyzed using XLSTAT and TASSEL 3.0. The candidate loci were analyzed by functional gene detection of the significant SNPs aligned
to the Rice Annotation Project and the Institute for Genomic Research databases. Three linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks were detected in the Fe tolerant population around the significant SNPs. The first LD block was mapped in chromosome 1 (the AtIRT gene and qFETOX1;
qFETOX1-3 QTLs loci) resembled partitioning of Fe toxicity tolerant mechanism. The second LD blocks located in chromosome 2 (qFETOX-2-1 and qFETOX-2 QTLs loci) and chromosome 3 (qFETOX-3 QTL, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 loci), probably contributed to Fe exclusion mechanism. The third LD blocks located in chromosome 4 (OsFRO2 and qFETOX-4 QTL loci) and chromosome 7 (OsIRT2 and NAS3 loci).
The third LD block was found on tolerant genotypes both on vegetative and generative stages. This condition indicated that these loci were presumed playing a role for Fe toxicity tolerance in rice. Results of the study are beneficial for determining the strategy on developing Fetoxicity tolerant rice for specific swamp land type through breeding programs.

,"ANALISIS KANDUNGAN KLOROFIL PLANLET ANGGREK BULAN
[Phalaenopsis amabilis (L.) BI.] HASIL INDUKSI LARUTAN ATONIK
DAN POLY ETHYLENE GLYCOL (PEG) 6000 SECARA IN VITRO","Anggrek Bulan [Phalaenopsis amabilis ( L.) BI.] salah satu jenis anggrek yang
banyak digemari oleh berbagai kalangan, selain memiliki keindahan bentuk dan warna
bunganya anggrek bulan juga memiliki nilai ekonomi yang tinggi. Kendala dalam
pembudidayaan P.amabilis ini adalah ketersediaan air yang kurang dan kelembapan yang
rendah. Penambahan zat pengatur tumbuh atonik dapat meningkatkan pertumbuhan tanaman.
Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh interaksi antara larutan atonik dan PEG
6000 terhadap pertumbuhan, kandungan klorofil planlet P. amabilis. Penelitian ini telah
dilaksanakan pada bulan Oktober-Desember 2019 di Ruang Penelitian In Vitro, Laboratorium
Botani, Jurusan Biologi, Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam, Universitas
Lampung. Penelitian ini menggunakan Rancangan Acak Lengkap Faktorial (RALF) yang
terdiri dari dua faktor yaitu larutan atonik dengan 3 taraf konsentrasi: 0 ml/l; 2 ml/l; 3 ml/l
dan PEG 6000 dengan 2 taraf konsentrasi: 0%; dan 25%, dengan masing-masing konsentrasi
dilakukan 4 kali ulangan dan setiap ulangan terdiri dari 2 planlet P. amabilis. Homogenitas
ragam diuji menggunakan uji Levene dilanjutkan dengan Uji Two Way Factorial Anova pada
taraf nyata 5% dan uji lanjut Beda Nyata Jujur (BNJ) pada taraf nyata 5%. Hasil penelitian
menunjukkan interaksi antara PEG 6000 konsentrasi 25% dan atonik konsentrasi 2 ml/l dapat
meningkatkan kandungan klorofil a, klorofil b dan klorofil total.",QK,Biosaintifika: Journal of Biology & Biology Education,2020,
