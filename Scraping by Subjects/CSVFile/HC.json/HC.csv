FEB5,Strengthen the Role of Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) to Improve Social Welfare and Reduce Inequality in Rural Areas: Lesson from Indonesia,"The primary purpose of the village fund is to lessen the gap between urban and rural and increase social welfare in the Village. However, the existence of this village fund has not been fully optimized to improve the welfare of rural communities that have received village funds from the government. The multiplier effect of the village funds allocation only focuses on the physical infrastructure development sector, such as roads, buildings, and bridges, up to 37%. In comparison, the allocation to the community development sector is only 8%, or the smallest allocation from other sectors (social health, education, and investigation). In this case, Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) have a vital role in developing a community that combines the for-profit and social organization sectors. BUMDes aims to develop the village economy and public services, manage village potential, create markets and employment opportunities, and increase business and income for villagers. This study analyses BUMDes effectiveness, which uses a descriptive and quantitative method using an approach of difference in difference (DID) approach. This was chosen based on the argument that this research would be helpful for policymakers, especially the government, who have a role in the village fund program, and village officials, who also play a role in the use of village funds for the community's welfare through maximizing BUMDes.","HC, HD",,2022-08,

MSME actors in Indonesia. Therefore, a study was conducted on the effect of these variables. Background of the problem: The transition of MSMEs in Indonesia to using e-commerce for carrying out their business transactions. Every year, there is an increase in the number of MSMEs converting from conventional to digital, as well as the government's
contribution to assist in the transition. Novelty: The variable of interest in transacting through e-commerce is the basis for conventional businesses to switch to digital, but in other studies, no one has added a variable of
trust as an intervening variable, and several other supporting variables for the interest in transacting via e-commerce. This study presents new research that provides a comprehensive view of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and how it relates to trust and interest in e-
commerce transactions. Research Methods: This study uses a snowball sampling technique by employing a survey of the MSMEs in Indonesia with certain criteria. This study also uses structural equation modeling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS). Findings/Results: This study proves that all the variables of trust and interest in e-commerce
transactions are supportive and significant, but there are two hypotheses that do not support them (H3 and H6). This shows that empirically MSMEs are not necessarily interested in using e-commerce for their business transactions. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the

The quality of accounting information in government is heavily dependent on the leadership's commitment, the effectiveness of internal control, and the execution of good governance, according to various published works; nevertheless, this must be demonstrated further. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the link and size of the influence of these three elements on the quality of accounting information and their impact on the efficacy of local government fixed asset management. In Indonesia, 34 provincial governments, 416 district governments, and 98 city governments were surveyed for this quantitative research. This study included 529 participants. The research data was gathered using a questionnaire instrument that included in-person interviews—data analysis using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with Lisrel 8.8 statistical software. The explanation of research findings is both descriptive and causally explanatory. In general, local governments in Indonesia have excellent accounting data and management of fixed assets. In carrying out local government tasks, the local government has also built an effective internal control system and excellent governance. The study's findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of internal control and the function of good governance substantially impact the quality of accounting data. Similarly, leadership commitment, the importance of good governance, and the accuracy of accounting information substantially impact the success of fixed asset management.

maximum limit on budget deficit of 3 %. This concept like Maastricht Treaty which is used in some Europe
Countries which are facing high debt and to be default countries, and we worried about it. The weakness of this
concept is thatdoes not describe when government is supposed to do the policy deficit, balanced, or surplus budget.
As long as GDP increases, government debt can be increased, regardless of whether the economy needs it or not.
Debt burden make fiscal space is limited and it has been happened in Indonesia in 1990’s.  It is important to build
a equilibrium model to control debt and budget deficit and the important thing it  keep fiscal sustainability and

Salah satu  upaya yang dilakukan adalah menambah utang pemerintah, namun ketidak hati-hatian dalam mengelola utang mengakibatkan perekonomian terjebak pada debt trap. Konsep pengelolaan utang dan defisit anggaran yang berorientasi  jangka panjang  (steady state) yang diterapkan di Indonesia adalah model defisit penyetabil utang, yaitu model dengan menetapkan tingkat utang dan  defisit anggaran pada tingkat tertentu. Pertanyannya seberapa efektifkah  model pengelolaan utang tersebut mampu  menciptakan pertumbuhan ekonomi jangka panjang karena secara empiris negara negara yang menganut konsep ini sedang mengalami masalah fiskal dan juga menuju ketidakstabilan perekonomian. New Concensus Economy adalah pemikiran model keseimbangan umum yang memuat 6 pasar dalam suatu perekonomian terbuka, semua agent rasional dan mengandung intertemporal choices serta ada  unsur kaidah kebijakan di dalamnya. Dengan memasukkan kaidah Debt Stabilizing Deficit (DSD)  ke dalam model keseimbangan tersebut diperoleh hasil bahwa, dalam jangka panjang ,penerapan DSD ini mampu menurunkan tingkat kesenjangan output, ada kenaikan harga-harga umum, menurunkan tingkat suku bunga, penguatan nilai tukar domestik  sehingga kondisi  neraca perdagangan menjadi lebih baik. Sementara, dalam jangka pendek, penerapan  kaidah DSD ini tidak signifikan mempengaruhi pembentukan harga, suku bunga, nilai tukar dan variasi dalam neraca perdagangan. Temuan lainnya adalah jika dilakukan penambahan tingkat utang  pada besaran tertentu namun  masih di bawah 60% PDB, kebijakan ini  masih mampu meningkatkan kinerja perekonomian.  Tingkat harga adalah variabel yang  paling cepat menyesuaikan kembali menuju keseimbangan, sedangkan tingkat suku bunga membutuhkan waktu lebih  lama  kembali menuju keseimbangan semula.

Beberapa penelitian percepatan diversifikasi konsumsi pangan yang telah dilakukan beberapa peneliti  menghasilkan model kebijakan yang masih bersifat umum, dengan melakukan kajian langsung pada  produk penelitian ini akan menghasilkan model kebijakan yang lebih implementatif.  Penelitian ini mengkaji pemilihan pangan dari dua aspek besar yaitu perilaku makan (diseminasi diversifikasi pangan) dan aksesabilitas pangan., dengan pendekatan dari dua aspek tersebut dibangun model percepatan diversifikasi konsumsi pangan. Model percepatan diversifikasi konsumsi pangan disusun dari pelaksanaan penelitian selama 3 tahun, tahun 2019 merupakan tahun akhir pelaksanaan penelitian ini.  
	Penelitian  dilaksanakan dengan pendekatan kuantitatif dan kualitatif, dilaksanakan selama 3 tahun (2017-2019).  Dua cakupan besar penelitian ini adalah  aspek diseminasi diversifikasi pangan dan aksesabilitas pangan lokal, dimana dari dua aspek tersebut dipecah menjadi 6 modul penelitian.  Enam modul tersebut: (1) Infusi Program Diversifikasi Pangan, (2) Aksesabilitas Masyarakat terhadap Pangan Lokal Olahan, (3) Diseminasi Program Diversifikasi Pangan, (4) Strategi Pemasar-an Pangan Lokal Olahan, (5) Transformasi Pola Diseminasi Diversifikasi Pangan dan Pemasaran Pangan Lokal Olahan, dan (6)  Formulasi Kebijakan Percepatan Diversifikasi Konsumsi Pangan.  Metode pengumpulan data pada seba-gian besar modul dilakukan dengan wawancara yang berpedoman pada kuesioner yang telah disiapkan (modul 1,2, dan 4).  Selain wawancara pengumpulan data juga dilakukan dengan observasi, studi dokumen, dan Focus Group Discussion (FGD).  Pelaksanaan pengumpulan data: modul 1 dan 2 dilaksanakan tahun I, modul 3 dan 4 tahun II, dan modul 5 dan 6dilaksanakan tahun III.  Objek penelitian mencakup rumah tangga , agroindustri bihun tapioka dan beras siger, dan para  pejabat (pemangku kepentingan) pada lingkup sistem pangan (penyediaan, distribusi, dan konsumsi).  Lokasi penelitian, untuk objek rumah tangga dilaksanakan di Kota Metro (daerah sekitar agroindustri bihun tapioka), Kelurahan Pinang Jaya Kota Bandar Lampung (wilayah nonpemasaran bihun tapioka), Desa Margosari Kabupaten Pringsewu (daerah sekitar agroindustri beras siger), dan Desa Mulyorejo (wilayah nonpemasaran beras siger).  Analisis data dilakukan dengan   deskriptif  kuantitatif dan kualitatif, yang digunakan untuk mengidentifikasi faktor internal dan eksternal organisasi yang selanjutnya digunakan untuk menyusun strategi  yang dilakukan dengan metode Strenght, Weakness, Opportunities, dan Threath (SWOT). Dari alternatif strategi yang dihasilkan dari analisis SWOT dipilih untuk memperoleh strategi prioritas dengan FGD dan pemberian rating terhadap alternatif strategi yang muncul. Alternatif strategi terpilih dielaborasi dalam bentuk alternatif kebijakan.
	Luaran utama yang ditargetkan dalam penelitian ini adalah Model Kebijakan Percepatan Diversifikasi Konsumsi Pangan.  Luaran utama tersebut ditinjau dari Tingkat Keterterapan Teknologinya (TKT) berada pada level 6. Fokus penelitian ini adalah bidang Pangan dan Pertanian, namun luaran yang berupa kebijakan masuk dalam TKT Sosial Humaniora.  Untuk sosial humaniora TKT 6 berarti status luaran merupakan hasil litbang penting dan signifikan untuk mendukung keputusan dan kebijakan.  Sampai dengan saat ini telah disusun kesimpulan dari hasil analisis serta pembuatan rekomendasi telah dibuat (indikator 1 dan 2).  Rancangan rekomendasi yang berupa alternatif regulasi dan intervensi pemerintah sedang disusun. Daftar pihak terkait dengan regulasi telah diketahui yaitu Pemerintah Daerah khususnya beberapa dinas antara lain Dinas Ketahanan Pangan, Dinas Pertanian dan Tanaman Pangan, Dinas Perindustrian dan Perdagangan, Dinas Kesehatan, Dinas Pendidikan, dan Dinas Pariwisata, serta Dinas Komunikasi dan Informasi. Komunikasi dengan pihak terkait sudah mulai dilakukan.
	Selain luaran utama, penelitian ini juga menjanjikan luaran tambahan yang berupa publikasi ilmiah baik pada jurnal nasional (terakreditasi dan tidak) serta jurnal internasional; pemakalah dalam temu ilmiah serta buku ajar (referensi).  Sebagian luaran tambahan sudah terpenuhi, namun masih ada yang sedang dalam proses penyelesaian.

For this purpose, this study uses CO2 emission as endogenous indicators and GDP per capita, the use of energy, urbanization, and trade liberalization as exogenous indicators. Annual time series data are taken from World Development Indicators (WDI) for the period of 1970 to 2018. First of all, in order to check the characteristics of the indicator ADF and PP unit root tests are applied. Results indicate that Trade and Urbanization are stationary at a level while rests of all are at first difference. Further, the study uses the ARDL-bound test to check the co-integration in the model and verifies the existence of co-integration. The long run results are estimated by ARDL methodology. Results confirmed that there does not exit the EKC hypothesis in Indonesia because economic growth boosts the carbon production level in Indonesia. Energy consumption also creates environmental degradation while trade decreases the carbon emission level. Urbanization has not significantly influenced the level of the environment. It is just because of the country's high urban development, energy use is still less due to the less income of the majority of population, and this may be one of the explanations why urbanization is not affecting the country's carbon dioxide pollution.

Secara teori dinyatakan bahwa manfaat disclosure bagi perusahaan akan mengurangi asimetri informasi sehingga akan mengurangi biaya dana atau tingkat suku bunga hutang bagi perusahaan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk meneliti pengaruh disclosure pada biaya hutang, biaya modal dan risiko perusahaan. Sampel penelitian adalah seluruh perusahaan yang terdaftar di Bursa Efek Indonesia. Hasil penelitian menemukan bahwa (1) disclosure tidak mempengaruhi biaya dana dari hutang dan biaya modal, (2) disclosure mempengaruhi tingkat risiko perusahaan.

This study aims to develop a pastoral assessment based on the TOPSIS-Etropy-Inhomogeneity Method. This research was conducted in Lampung Province using data at the regency level. The data uses village data from the 2018 Village Potential Survey (PODES). The results show that rural areas' exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity factors play an essential role in rural development regarding vulnerability and resilience. Pesisir Barat, Mesuji, and Tulang Bawang Regencies are highly susceptible to low adaptation factors such as difficult access to health centers, inadequate credit facilities from the government, quiet village anticipation and mitigation, and a lack of security systems. The lowest vulnerabilities are in Tanggamus and North Lampung Regencies with common sensitivity factors, where people with malnutrition, persons with disabilities, households living in slums, and the habit of not using river water or the like for drinking or cooking have lower scores. In addition, other factors contribute to vulnerability, and these factors should be considered in rural development policies.","HB, HC, HJ",Jurnal Perspektif Pembiayaan dan Pembangunan Daerah,2022-08-31,
