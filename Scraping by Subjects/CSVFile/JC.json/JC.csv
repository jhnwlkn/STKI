The research will look at the political thinking of Thomas Hobbes in this series with the aim of analyzing the form of natural consciousness, social contract in the form of the State which is broadcast through storylines, dialogues and descriptions of the situation in the Korean drama series Squid Game. This article is a literature study on the state of nature, social contract and the concept of the state from Thomas Hobbes' political thought through the drama series Squid Game produced from South Korea. His opinion of the state is scary, cruel, and obeyed like Leviathan to make the disorderly state of human nature controllable. Human nature is homo homini lupus or humans are wolves to each other. The social contract according to Thomas Hobbes is an agreement between the people and the state, but the state is not bound by the social contract. The state/king position is above the social contract, the state has absolute authority or is called the king, it cannot be wrong. This study concludes that in the Korean drama series Squad Game, there is a thought by Thomas Hobbes which states the importance of absolute state power to create perfection. Peace can be obtained by presenting fear to the individual through the State, conflict will be avoided, society will be subject to the law with fear that is continuously maintained by the State.",JC,"Journal of Education, Humaniora and Social Sciences (JEHSS)",2022-11,

Research on distributive politics in the context of local politics, especially in the election of regional heads is still rare.

This research used qualitative method through in-depth interview approach to informants related to the research. The informant consisted of several political actors, Herman HN's successful team and academics. The result of this research indicates that politics of distributive among voters occurs in the selection of Bandar Lampung Mayor. There is a symbiotic mutualism between candidate and the voters in Bandar Lampung Local Election. Voters can be influenced by the choice of imaging of candidate, through the concept of distributive politics or pork barrels politics or provide necessary needs for the voting community with infrastructure policy; roads and bridges, free education, free health and religious social assistance. Other results indicate that the manipulative policies carried out by candidate make voters lulled to absurd performance that ends in the Bandar Lampung City budget crisis after the policy is rolled out.",JC,Politik Indonesia: Indonesian Political Science Review,2019-07-25,

I argue that religious parties have some electoral advantages from having religious voters as their primary supporters. However, they must have some strategies to attract median voters or other social classes outside their traditional base to win the election. They must also make a ""holy"" effort to maintain their morality as their religious and moral guardian in government, which is difficult in democratic politics. This essay also argues that Indonesia is an outlier in the winning trend of Islamic parties in religious societies across the globe, but further studies are needed because there is a new critical juncture. The rest of this essay will support my argument with some evidence from several countries.","JA, JC",Journal of Politics and Identity,2022,

FISIP3,Food Security and Entitlement: A Critical Analyses,"For the long decades, the Malthus idea of food supply became immensely popular when
we talk about the food security and famines. Malthus argues that the food security and
famines are caused by the lack of food supply. The growth of population creates more
food demand; on the other hand, the food supply is limited. The land for agriculture is
decreased, as an impact of rapid growth population (Malthus, 1789). The Malthusian
tradition emphasizes the drivers of demand. On this perspective, trend in population is
the crucial factor of the increase of food demand (Godfray, et. al. 2010, p. 2770-2772).
In addition, based on this point of view, the policy instrument proposed is related to the
control of the population such as female education and promoting easy access to
contraception. Furthermore, they also argue that the problem of food also is caused by
the supply side. The decrease of crop yield is the significant factor of the decreases of
food supply.","HB, JC",Survey of Critical Concept,,

FISIP3,COMPETING MODELS IN POLITICAL COALITION ANALYSIS: SYSTEM OR TRANSACTIONAL?,"Abstract 
Systems analysis is very popular in social sciences. The structural functionalism theory espoused by Parsons, Easton’s with political system, and Almond’s explanation on the role of individual politics through biological organism analogy. All these theories place emphasis on the importance of norms, roles, function, structure, law, coercion and equilibrium in the given system. Nevertheless, these models fail to explain the conduct of wrong-doers which are in conflict with norms, order and laws. In daily occurrences there are those who craftily circumvent the system in such a way that their actions are unnoticeable. Such individuals place their interests foremost even if they are in conflict with norms and order. Thus the transactional model tries to explain the conduct of such individuals who give emphasis on interest and opportunity at the expense of system. This study utilises the transactional model to analyse the formation and fragmentation of political coalition with reference to Malaysia and Indonesia. In this context, the transactional approach is more realistic in explaining political transformation. It also places the individual’s role in a more meaningful position by not merely being subjected to regulation and system. The individual is free to use their ability and thoughts in deciding the suitable outcome, opting for a rational choice and does not react like an ordinary member of society who is subjected to social coercion and norms. Individuals are consistently competing due to limited resources and have often to make the best choice from limited options available.

Our results also contribute to further developing incumbency theory.

FISIP6,A post-tsunami sea change? Towards post-secular disaster response in Indonesia,"The role of religious actors in disaster response, an issue that is generally understood as being dominated by secular perspectives, is increasingly receiving attention. Surprisingly considering its likelihood to offer relevant insights, however, the concept of post-secularism has seldom been adopted as an analytical framework. In response, in this study we adopt a Habermasian lens to examine the relations between religious and secular actors in Indonesia with respect to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, with particular focus on domestic faith organisations. Through interviewing representatives from three prominent religious organisations and a figure from a relevant independent statutory authority, we highlight these institutions' contributions to the disaster response, alongside their struggles to legitimise their leadership potential. Thus, by demonstrating the existence of constraints on religious groups playing a consequential role in a public concern that would benefit from multiple perspectives and competencies, we exemplify how Habermas’ vision of a post-secular society is playing out in a disaster context and identify areas in which collaboration between ostensibly secular and religious actors might be improved.","G1, GE, GN, H1, JA, JC, JF, JS",A post-tsunami sea change?
