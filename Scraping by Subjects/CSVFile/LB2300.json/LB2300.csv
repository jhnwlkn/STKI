,THE EFFECT OF FEEDBACK AS SOFT SCAFFOLDING ON ONGOING ASSESSMENT TOWARD THE QUANTUM PHYSICS CONCEPT MASTERY OF THE PROSPECTIVE PHYSICS TEACHERS,"Many recent studies have reported that feedback plays a very important role in students’ learning outcomes. However, currently, feedback has not been utilized by lecturers and students in the learning process effectively. This study aimed to explore the impact of feedback as a soft scaffolding in the ongoing assessment of Quantum Physics class for the students as prospective Physics teachers. A quasi-experimental design non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group was used to examine the effectiveness of feedback based on ongoing assessment. The results of the study revealed that students who received feedback based on metacognitive and social constructivism on studying Quantum Physics showed better average results compared to students who received traditional 
feedback based on the cognitivism in the form of correction.","L1, LB, LB2300",Jurnal Pendidikan IPA Indonesia,2018-03-19,

FKIP21,"Students’ conceptions and problem-solving ability on topic
chemical thermodynamics","The enthalpy concept and its change were introduced to describe the forms of internal energy transfer in
chemical reactions. Likewise, the concepts of exothermic and endothermic reactions introduced as a consequence of heat
transfer form. In the heat measurement process at constant pressure, work is often ignored. The exothermic or
endothermic reactions, usually only based on the increase or decrease of the reaction temperature, without associated
with the internal energy. Depictions of enthalpy and its change assumed closely related to students’ problem-solving
ability. Therefore, the study to describe pre-service chemistry teacher student’s conceptions and problem-solving ability
on topic chemical thermodynamics has been done. This research was a case study of chemical education course in
Provinsi Lampung. The subjects of this study were 42 students who attend the chemical thermodynamics course.
Questions about exothermic and endothermic reactions, enthalpy and its change, as well as internal energy and its change
were given in the form of an essay exam questions. Answers related to conception qualitatively categorized, while
problem solving answers were scored and assessed. The results showed that, in general, students were having problems in
enthalpy and describe the changes in the form of heat and work. The highest value of problem solving ability obtained
26.67 from the maximum value of 100. The lowest value was 0, and the average value was 14.73. These results show that
the problem-solving ability of pre-service chemistry teacher students was low. The results provide insight to researchers,
and educators to develop learning or lab work on this concept.",LB2300,,2016-02,

FKIP21,"Using Project-Based Learning To Design, Build, and Test Student-Made Photometer by Measuring the Unknown Concentration of Colored Substances","Students learned the principles and practice of photometry through project-based learning. They addressed the challenge of measuring the unknown concentration of a colored substance using a photometer they were required to design, build, and test. Then, they used that instrument to carry out the experiment and fulfill the challenge. A photometer was designed and built by students consisting of a green laser pointer as the light source and a lux meter as the detector and readout. Using this photometer students have determined the concentration of the unknown sample of KMnO4 solutions. The concentration of this sample solution was calculated to be (4.62 ± 0.06) × 10−4 M; this value agrees within 6% of the expected value from the measurement using the commercial spectrophotometer which was calculated to be (4.96 ± 0.005) × 10−4 M. The experiments fit well into an analytical chemistry course and take a standard (1 h) lab period. This project has facilitated improved student understanding of the photometry concepts and increased the creative problem-solving. In general, the students’ response to this laboratory was positive.

problems. This paper presents the results of our research on the
development of optics learning model that was designed for the
purpose of building mental models and problem solving ability,
especially in the topic of light refraction. The learning model is
called “ExPRession” model, developed based on one model of
PBL namely the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy
(IMSA) model. Furthermore, we integrated the Polya’s and
Heller & Heller problem solving strategies to IMSA PBL. We
implemented our model in a limited test that conducted to 16
students of the 5th semester in physics education at Lampung
University who were enrolled in an optics course. The learning
model was implemented in three topics such as rectilinear
propagation of light, refraction of light on a flat surface, and
refraction of light on a curved surface. The results showed that
“ExPRression” learning models could be categorized as “valid
in contents” and as “valid in constructions”, categorized as
""practical"", and categorized as “effective”. The developed
learning tools can be classified as a valid and could be used to
support the implementation of the ""Expression"" learning
model. The results in limited test showed that “ExPRression”
learning model was effective in building mental model and

The art class was conducted using the Learning Management System (LMS) and attended by 31 Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini (PAUD) students, and arts department. This research method uses a survey derived from two types of data. The first data was obtained from a questionnaire distributed to 211 art students. Factors that determine copy-paste occur because of the tendency to postpone tasks, so they work at the end of time. The following data comes from the discussion assignment report done by the student. Tasks are scanned online using the application. The results of the analysis of plagiarism showed an average of 49.09%, with a word similarity level of 80.77%. Based on online scan reports, the source of plagiarism comes from the university repository. Students use Open Educational Resource (OER) in the form of dictates as material for doing art lecture assignments. In conclusion, students mistakenly understood the use of OER and digital literacy. Digital-based arts learning does not have a significant impact and requires the provision of academic writing.

FKIP1,A TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE INCORPORATING STUDENTS’ OWN GOAL AND  THEIR INSTITUTIONAL GOAL IN BIG-SIZED ENGLISH CLASSES,"This paper reports a study on a teaching and learning practice in three big-sized English classes incorporating the learning goal set by the students and that by their institution, which investigated three questions: 1) What do the students perceive at a text-based teaching and learning?; 2) What problems do the students face at the text-based teaching and learning class?; and 3) What do the students learn at the text-based teaching and learning? The subjects of this study were 208 first year students of a state engineering institute in Lampung, Sumatera, Indonesia. The 208 students were from 3 different classes. The teaching and learning activities were based on academic texts selected by the students in a group of ten. In every meeting a group of the students who had prepared a two-page English academic text presented its title and key words to the class, whereas the other groups asked questions based on the title and key words which had to be answered by the group orally. In every meeting at the end of the class the students were asked to write a journal according to the research questions. The results showed that they perceived the teaching and learning practice differently, they had some problems, but they learnt some linguistic elements and skills, and  they realized that they still needed to improve their English skill as well as their participation in speaking.","LB2300, PE",,2017,

FKIP1,EFL learners’ beliefs about positive and negative effects of translation as a learning strategy in Indonesia,"The use of translation as a learning strategy has been extensively studied, but less attention has been paid to beliefs about the positive and negative effects of translation in EFL learning. This study attempts to describe EFL learners’ beliefs about positive and negative effects of translation as a learning strategy by adopting a quantitative approach in which the data were collected by using questionnaires. The findings reveal that Indonesian EFL learners believe translation can help them learn EFL and that despite some potential negative effects, translation will not inhibit their learning. Both beliefs about positive and negative effects of translation simultaneously affect the use of translation as a learning strategy to help EFL learners learn EFL, but the belief about positive effects of translation makes a more significant contribution to it. The study’s implications and limitations with some recommendations for future research are also discussed.","H1, HD28, L1, LB2300, LC5201",Asian Journal of Applied Linguistics,2019-11-05,
FKIP1,The Implementation of Focus on Form and Focus on Meaning Instructions in English Language Teaching at the University of Lampung,"This research was aimed at investigating the English ability of students of Physics Department of the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education at the University of Lampung before and after the implementation of Focus on Form and Focus on Meaning instructions, and at finding out the effectiveness of the two English language teaching instructions in increasing their English ability. This study applied a quantitative method through static-group comparison by using two instruments, a multiple-choice test and a speaking test. This study was conducted in two classes at the Department of Physics Education, Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, the University of Lampung. They were students of the first semester 2014/2015 Academic Year studying English as a foreign language at the intermediate level for one semester. A total of 69 students were chosen as participants of this study with an average age of 18. The results show that it is better to apply Focus on Meaning instruction for teaching English speaking that that of Focus on Form. In terms of accuracy and mastery of linguistic forms, however, it is slightly better to use the Focus on Form instruction than that of Focus on Meaning. The Focus on Form instruction is proved to be effective enough to improve students’ grammatical ability. This gives an indication that this pedagogical technique is effective for diverting students’ attention to the grammatical aspects as they engage in activities that prioritize the understanding and delivery of written messages. While the Focus on Meaning instruction is proved to be effective to improve students’ speaking ability. Students who are taught using the Focus on meaning instruction are accustomed to conveying ideas without fear of making mistakes because through this instruction, grammatical errors are not particularly noticed, however, they are not entirely ignored either, yet the conditions are slightly tolerable.

FKIP1,English as an International Language: Perceptions of EFL Preservice Teachers in Higher Education Institutions in Indonesia,"It is widely known that the English language has rapidly spread across the globe and is now used for a wide range of purposes. Its status as a national/foreign language has shifted to that of an international language. Despite this awareness, however, studies on perceptions of English as an international language (EIL) among EFL preservice teachers in the Indonesian context are not commonplace in the literature. Therefore, this study was aimed at elucidating the perceptions of the four aspects of EIL among EFL preservice teachers in higher education institutions in Indonesia. This quantitative study adopted a descriptive approach using a five-point Likert scale questionnaire with a total of 14 close-ended statements. Data collected from the questionnaire were analysed using descriptive statistics. The findings suggest that EIL is positively viewed by participants as a means of global communication to achieve a variety of purposes. They welcome and accept various varieties of English, demonstrating a strong multilingual/multicultural understanding through their ability to accept different pronunciation patterns and adapt their behavior and conversational styles when interacting with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. They have a strong sense of ownership over their own English varieties. Finally, the study’s implications for the four aspects of EIL including the current status of English, English varieties, multicultural communication strategies, and the identity of English speakers are also discussed, along with limitations and recommendations for future research.","H1, L1, LB2300, PE",Education Research International,2022-04-21,

using an online questionnaire to collect data, which was
distributed via Google Forms. A descriptive analysis was
performed on the collected data. The findings indicate that
teachers in elementary and secondary schools in Indonesia
believe their online learning is ineffective during the COVID-19
pandemic. One reason they rated their online learning
ineffective during the COVID-19 pandemic is that their
inability to adapt to a new culture of online instruction, which
could be interpreted as a result of their classes not being
prepared online. Therefore, the findings imply that an
appropriate online instructional design for online learning must

Without vocabulary, there will be nothing to be conveyed in the sense of form and meaning. Despite its importance, in some EFL countries like Indonesia, the teaching and learning of vocabulary depends mostly on prescribed text books which are less authentic and provide only a few of examples of contextual language use. This study analyses the impact of using English movies to facilitate vocabulary meaning recognition of Indonesian EFL learners. The participants of this study were 26 students of English Department in Universitas Bandar Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia. The participants were given vocabulary pre-test to see their prior vocabulary knowledge. After the pre-test, the participants took part in four-session movie class where they watch ‘The Social Network’, a movie about the invention of Facebook, to acquire and understand the targeted vocabulary items. After three weeks, the participants did another test to assess their understanding towards the vocabulary items. The results of both pre-test and post-test were compared. The findings show that watching English movies help EFL learners to retain vocabulary meaning.

Besides revealing that learning strategies affected the language achievement, this study has found that metacognitive strategies proved to be the best predictor of success in learning English. The findings of this study also revealed that motivation was an individual difference that was related with the use of language learning strategies. Since in this investigation it has been shown that low achievers employed strategies that are predictive of success less frequently than high achievers, teachers should provide opportunities for their students to employ self-evaluation and self-correction to enable students to use their metacognitive strategies optimally. Teachers should provide opportunities for their students to be involved in the highest level of mental processes: metacognitive strategies. Students should also have analytical skills in the linguistic forms in order to be able to compare their actual performance and the expected performance in order for the metacognitive strategies to work optimally. This can be done by, to some extent, providing students with formal study grammar for the conscious monitor.

Representation and Its Interconversion on Chirality","Abstract. This study aims at describing (1) students’ level comprehension; (2) factors causing difficulties to 3D
comprehend molecule representation and its interconversion on chirality. Data was collected using multiplechoice test
consisting of eight questions. The participants were required to give answers along with their reasoning. The test was developed based on the indicators of concept comprehension. The study was conducted to 161 college students enrolled in stereochemistry topic in the odd semester (2014/2015) from two LPTK (teacher training institutes) in Bandar Lampung and Gorontalo, and one public university in Bandung. The result indicates that college students' level of comprehension towards 3D molecule representations and its interconversion was 5% on high level, 22 % on the moderate level, and 73 % on the low level. The dominant factors identified as the cause of difficulties to comprehend 3D molecule representation and its interconversion were (i) the lack of spatial awareness, (ii) violation of absolute configuration determination rules, (iii) imprecise placement of observers, (iv) the lack of rotation operation, and (v) the lack of understanding of correlation between the representations. This study recommends that learning show more rigorous 
spatial awareness training tasks  accompanied using dynamic visualization media of molecules associated. Also students
learned using static molecular models  can help them overcome their difficulties encountered.","LB, LB2300",,2016,

The research aims at investigating the frequency of students’ use of L2-based communication strategies, the effects of teaching L2-based communication strategies on the students’ autonomy in speaking and the students’ speaking achievement. This research was conducted through quasi-experimental in which all students numbering of 33 received the same treatment. The data of the research were collected through speaking test and questionnaire. The data were then analyzed through recording, coding, and were interpreted through repeated measure t-test. The results show that there were 6 L2-based communication strategies used by the students. Before treatment the students used circumlocution (95), approximation (30), comparison (12), exemplification (10), word coinage (3), and foreignizing (1). After treatment, students used circumlocution (125), approximation (65), comparison (30), exemplification (20), word coinage (6), and foreignizing (1). The students were more independent and more autonomous in speaking in which t-value (11.807) is higher than t-table (2.042). Moreover, students’ score in speaking significantly increased from the average score 64.5 to 70.7 in which t-value (14.200) is higher than t-table (2.042).

It is claimed that the condition of the words in a reading materials has a great influence on readers’ comprehension. This case study was carried out in Undergraduate Program of State University of Malang (UM). The aim of the study is to identify and describe the vocabulary in the reading materials and to seek if the text is useful for reading skill development. A descriptive qualitative design was applied to obtain the data. For this purpose, some available computer programs were used. They were used to find the description of vocabulary in the texts. It was found that the texts, containing 7,945 words of 20 different texts, are dominated by low frequency words which account for 16.97% of the words in the texts. In terms of high frequency words occurring in the texts, function words dominate the texts. In the case of word levels, it was found that the texts being used have very limited number of words from GSL (West, 1953). The proportion of the first 1,000 words of GSL only accounts for 44.6%. The data also show that the texts contain too large proportion of words which are not in the three levels (the first 2,000 and UWL). These words account for 26.44% of the running words in the texts.  It is believed that the constraints are due to the selection of the texts which are made of a series of short-unrelated texts (Stahl, K. and Bravo, 2010).

The input-output means has been proven to be able to influence the process of second language acquisition (Izumi et al., 1999). A comprehensible approach called Interactive Input-Output Instruction Written designed and developed to maximize input obtained through reading materials that were then used to produce meaningful paper or essay. Assuming that there was a problem with the ability of students to use the language, especially in terms of ability to write, which is important for every students of English, type of learning in a group can be used to benefit the students to get input from the reading process to influence their writing skills. In groups, the students were given a writing assignment that must be completed. This writing task brings a bias problem solved by recourse through the reading process. Therefore, the reading was done with a purpose and contribution of each member in the group is very helpful in completing the task of writing. The study involved 36 students who attend Mathematics English courses in the first semester of academic year 2016/2017. The students were given the opportunity to process narrative and anecdotal text, made text reconstruction, paragraph predicting continued, wrote prediction, give and receive feedback and make revisions. The results show there significant difference between students’ ability to write comprehensible Written before implementation Interactive Input-Output Instruction and after implementation comprehensible Written Interactive Input-Output Instruction.

determination of acidity constant and pH range of indicators needs to be done. This study aims to determine the
acidity constant (pKa) of mangosteen pericarp extract and its accuracy as an indicator of acid-base titration.
Determination of pKa was done by a simple potentiometric titration method. The titration data were plotted in
three graphs, i.e., pH, ΔpH/ΔV (the (the first derivative), and Δ2pH/ΔV2 (the second derivative) versus titrant
volume to determine the equivalence point of the titration. The accuracy test was carried out by comparing the
volume of oxalic acid used to titrate NaOH solution using the indicator of mangosteen pericarp extract and
phenolphthalein indicator. The result showed that the equivalence point was found on the titrant volume of 8.6
mL and a measured pH of 9.84. so the pKa value of mangosteen pericarp extract was 7.20, and the pH range
was 6.20 to 8.20. the average volume of oxalic acid used to titrate 5 mL of NaOH using phenolphthalein as the
indicator was 5.2 mL while the titration used mangosteen pericarp extract was 5.23 mL. The accuracy of
mangosteen pericarp extract was 99.42%. By the result, it can be concluded that potentiometric titration can be
used as a simple way to determine the acidity constant of mangosteen pericarp extract. Moreover, the
