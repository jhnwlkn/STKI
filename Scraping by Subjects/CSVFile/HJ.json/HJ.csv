Background of the problem: The transition of MSMEs in Indonesia to using e-commerce for carrying out their business transactions. Every year, there is an increase in the number of MSMEs converting from conventional to digital, as well as the government's
contribution to assist in the transition. Novelty: The variable of interest in transacting through e-commerce is the basis for conventional businesses to switch to digital, but in other studies, no one has added a variable of
trust as an intervening variable, and several other supporting variables for the interest in transacting via e-commerce. This study presents new research that provides a comprehensive view of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and how it relates to trust and interest in e-
commerce transactions. Research Methods: This study uses a snowball sampling technique by employing a survey of the MSMEs in Indonesia with certain criteria. This study also uses structural equation modeling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS). Findings/Results: This study proves that all the variables of trust and interest in e-commerce
transactions are supportive and significant, but there are two hypotheses that do not support them (H3 and H6). This shows that empirically MSMEs are not necessarily interested in using e-commerce for their business transactions. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the
trust and interest in e-commerce transactions among MSME business actors. We suggest that the MSMEs should switch to using e-commerce for their transactions, to develop their businesses into digital ones.","HC, HJ",,2023-01-27,

ACCOUNTING, THE EFFECT ON PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL
REPORTING QUALITY AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN INDONESIA","In Indonesia local government, accrual based Government Accounting Standard (GAS) was started to be mandatorily applied in 2015, so this research aims to investigate to what extent the role of accrual GAS implementation toward quality of financial reporting and financial performance especially at local governments. Population of this study is Local Governments of districts/cities in Indonesia for Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2015, as many as 542 local governments (before and after the implementation of accrual base).  Sampling method uses probability sampling which is cluster sampling. In this case, the population is divided based on 34 province clusters, so the number of sample obtained is 242 local governments of districts/cities in Indonesia.  The hypothesis testing uses paired t test. The object of research is the financial reporting quality and financial performance. The results of this study provide empirical evidence that there is an increase in the quality of financial reporting after the application of accrual-based accounting at local governments in Indonesia, but have not proven the existence of the increased financial performance. There is no differences in financial performance before and after accrual based accounting implementation at local governments in Indonesia. This hyphothesis  was not supported due to the application of accrual basis accounting is still in the early stages of implementation (1 year) that still have constraints in limited human resources competencies, necessary adaptations or adjustments in the process of change. Local governments in Indonesia must apply accrual based accounting because it is proven that it increases financial report quality.  However, the system implementation in the beginning period found many obstacles so it needs continuous adjustment and learning in order to reach desirable goal. There is still a debate on how important is the implementation or adoption of accrual IPSAS in many countries, including Indonesia.  In Indonesia, the implementation of accrual based Government Accounting Standard (SAP/GAS) is new mandatory since 2015. The result of this research will give contribution to the theory, that there is significant influence of implementation accrual based GAS to financial reporting quality, but no significant increase in financial performance (efficiency and effectiveness) at local government.  Therefore, this result study will be used to determine related policies about the implementation of accrual based GAS.

This study uses a descriptive and quantitative approach, with a population of provinces / cities / districts in Indonesia, amounting to 522 per year. For 2017 and 2018, 1044 samples were obtained.

There are significant differences in the quality of financial reporting between local governments that have not and have implemented e-budgeting. The limitation of this study is that the research year can only be taken in the last 2 years (2017 and 2018), because e-planning and e-budgeting have only been implemented in that year. Practical implications based on the results of this study, the government must provide support for the implementation of e-planning and e-budgeting to improve the quality of financial statements.

The implementation of Act Number 6/2014 is reflected by being implemented the strategy, organization, movement, leadership, and good control so that it will create the transparent, accountable, and participative village finance management. The implication of this result is that villages must implement a high quality management accounting information system to produce quality information to improve village finance management. Sufficient socialization and assistance are required for the apparatuses in using that information system. Besides, the government must also have a good supervisory and performance measurement system to achieve accountable, transparent and participative village finance management. The large allocation of funds from the central government to the village in Indonesia (1 billion rupiah for 1 village), and a large number of villages (74,954 village) in Indonesia, requires good village finance management. This paper uses the System Quality, Service Quality, and System use by (DeLone and McLane, 2008) to measure the implementation of information systems in the village along with the quality of the information generated, and the implementation of  Republik Indonesia (RI) Act Number 6/2014 about The Village as the main factor that will affect the good village finance governance (Transparent, Accountable, Participative).","H1, HJ",,2018-11,

used was quantitative research using the correlation method. The data analysis
technique employed was multiple regression analysis and testing of classical

influence between ownership structure and firm value. Based on the results of
previous calculations, it can be seen that the value of the F-statistic was 35.186 with
the probability value of the F-statistic being 0.000. Since the prob value of the F-
statistic was 0.000<0.05 then H0 was rejected, meaning that together the ownership
structure has a significant effect on firm value. The study concluded that
Institutional Ownership, Foreign Ownership and Individual Ownership have a
significant effect on Firm Value. An increase in institutional ownership will reduce
the value of the company and vice versa. Foreign ownership has a positive effect
on firm value on the IDX which has been proven empirically and supports the
statements of previous researchers. Individual ownership has a negative effect on

Environmental costs, the disclosure of environmental, social disclosure, and ESG that observed in three
developing countries has increased significantly after 2007. However, we did not find a significant increase
in environmental costs in Indonesia. The findings of this study indicate that the theory of regulation,

FEB5,Building Economics Equilibrium Model Toward Macroeconomic Variables – New Consensus Macroeconomic Approach: Evidence from Indonesia,"Debt management and budget deficit in Indonesia is based on ACT No 17 of 2003 and followed by Government Regulation No 23 of 2003, in which government sets maximum limit on government debt of 60 % GDP and maximum limit on budget deficit of 3 %. This concept like Maastricht Treaty which is used in some Europe Countries which are facing high debt and to be default countries, and we worried about it. The weakness of this concept is that does not describe when government is supposed to do the policy deficit, balanced, or surplus budget. As long as GDP increases, government debt can be increased, regardless of whether the economy needs it or not. Debt burden make fiscal space is limited and it has been happened in Indonesia in 1990’s. It is important to build a equilibrium model to control debt and budget deficit and the important thing it keep fiscal sustainability and economic growth. Fiscal sustainability is happened if debt is kept stable. This research is conducted by using New Consensus Macroeconomic (MKB) school to make an optimal decision through inter temporal choices.Using micro foundation and adding debt stabilizing deficit variable, Arestis model was elaborated. The result found that deficit debt stabilizer in the model for a long term, gives positive impact on output gaps, the level of prices, exchange rates, current account, and primary budget deficits in Indonesia but it has no impact on the level of interest rates. Conversely, in a short term, debt deficit stabilizer in model gives positive impact toward output gap, exchange rate, and the primary deficit budget but it does not significantly influence interest rates, the level of price, and current account.","HB, HJ",Journal of Economic and Management Perspectives,2017,

FISIP3,ANALISIS EFISIENSI PENGGUNAAN KEUANGAN NEGARA DALAM PELAKSANAAN E-PROCUREMENT DI UNIVERSITAS LAMPUNG TAHUN 2013 DAN 2014,"Salah satu tujuan dari pengadaan barang/jasa pemerintah secara elektronik (eprocurement) adalah meningkatkan efisiensi penggunaan uang negara dengan tanpa mengurangi kualitas barang/jasa yang dibutuhkan oleh institusi pemerintahan; termasuk Universitas Lampung. Penelitian ini menjelaskan pelaksanaan e-procurement dari sisi kelembagaan dan metode pelaksanaan serta tingkat efisiensi penggunaan keuangan negara dalam pelaksanaan e-procurement di Universitas Lampung tahun anggaran 2013 dan 2014. Dengan asumsi terdapat dua pendekatan utama dalam mengukur dampak suatu program yakni, “with and without approach” dan “before and after approach”, maka pendekatan yang dilakukan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan before and after approach yakni analisis yang memerlukan kondisi sebelum dan setelah treatment (e-procurement) dilakukan di Universitas Lampung yang dianalisis dengan pendekatan kualitatif. Tiga tingkatan efisiensi yaitu efisiensi teknis, efisiensi ekonomis, dan efisiensi alokatif mengarahkan pada pilihan substansi dari penelitian ini yaitu efisiensi ekonomis dengan tiga fokus, yaitu efisiensi waktu, efisiensi biaya, dan efisiensi hasil.
Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pada tiga aspek efisiensi seluruhnya telah dapat dicapai. Dari sisi waktu, dalam pengadaan barang dengan pelelangan sederhana misalnya, jika dilaksanakan secara manual dibutuhkan waktu minimal 28 (dua puluh) delapan hari kerja, namun jika dilaksanakan dengan metode eprocurement hanya membutuhkan waktu 22 (dua puluh dua) hari kalender. Hari kerja dan hari kalender tentu berbeda. Pada sisi biaya, kebutuhan dana untuk biaya transportasi (untuk mendaftar dan memasukkan penawaran), biaya komunikasi (untuk mengikuti rapat penjelasan), biaya penggandaan (untuk penggandaan dokumen pelelangan), biaya pencetakan (untuk dokumen penawaran) serta lainnya dapat ditiadakan, karena seluruhnya dilakukan dengan cara elektronik. Secara kuantitas dapat disimpulkan bahwa pemberlakuan eprocurement di Universitas Lampung telah menghasilkan efisiensi sebesar 22,4% dibandingkan dengan pagu anggaran yang diturunkan ke dalam Harga Perkiraan Sendiri (HPS). Hal ini berarti telah terjadi efisiensi pada aspek efisiensi hasil. Dari jumlah nilai HPS di Universitas Lampung tahun anggaran 2013 dan 2014 sebesar 192,1 miliar rupiah telah terjadi efisiensi hasil yang setara dengan 25,9 miliar rupiah.","HG, HJ",,2015,

In the  government perspective, e-procurement is  conducted  as  an  effort  to  prevent  corruption, collusion,   and   nepotism.   In   the   context   of   service   acceleration, e-procurement is  the  manifestation  of new  public  management paradigm;an effort  to  improve  service  quality  by  encouraging  entrepreneurship  spirit  to realize efficiency of state finance use without reducing qualities of /services that  are  required  by  government  institutions.  This  research  was  conducted with  qualitative  method  with  an  objective  to  explore  the  implication  of e-procurementfor  the  efficiency  of  state  finance  use  and  improvement  of service  function  in  Lampung  University.  The result  showed  that  there  were three aspects of efficiency: time efficiency, cost efficiency, and efficiency of all  outcomes  had  been  attained.  In  the  perspective  of  time,  the  common auction process if it was conducted manually it would require minimum time of  28  working  days,  and  it  would  take  only  20  working  days  by e-procurement method.   In   the   cost   perspective,   the   fund   demand   for transportation  cost  (registration  and  submitting  offering),  communication cost  (joining  meeting  for  explanation),  duplication  cost  (duplicating  auction documents),  and  printing  cost  (offering  documents)  could  be  eliminated  by replacing    them    by    on-line    method.    The e-procurement enactment quantitatively  in  Lampung  University  in  2013-2014  produced  financial efficiency  by 22.4% and this indicated efficiency of outcomes. As results of this  efficiency  derivation,  by  havingstatus  of  Common  Service  Agency (BLU)  status,  Lampung  University  possessed  discretion  to  manage  this 22.4% fund efficiency for optimizing funding activities for “three pillars of higher education”(tridharma  perguruan  tinggi)  at  the  same  year  without waiting budget planning at the next fiscal year.

Some of the industries most impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic are those in the hotel, restaurant, and tourism industries. This study uses profitability and leverage to examine whether there are differences in the profitability and leverage situations before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. There are discrepancies between the findings of earlier studies, notably those by Darmawan et al., (2021), who found no differences between profitability before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. In this research, a comparative descriptive methodology and a quantitative technique were applied. From 2018 through 2022, financial statistics are used in this analysis. Purposive sampling was used to collect samples,  and  25  companies  that  match  the  criteria  were  found.When  data  were  not  normally distributed, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed instead of the paired sample t-test as the normality test. The study's conclusion demonstrates the leverage and profitability of businesses in the travel, dining, and hospitality sectors both before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. In the 25 organizations that were analyzed, the results revealed a significant value (α) of 5% and a decline in the value of profitability and leverage. This indicates that the Indonesian hotel, restaurant, and tourism sub-sector businesses have suffered as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

sebagai Variabel Moderasi (Effect of Profitability, Leverage, and Capital Structure on Firm Value with Dividend Policy as Moderating Variable)","Purpose: The COVID-19 epidemic has had a devastating impact on 
the international economy, particularly in Indonesia. The 
hospitality, dining, and tourism sectors are some of those most 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of profitability, 
leverage, capital structure, and dividend policy as moderating 
variables on firm value is investigated in this study for companies in 
the hotel, restaurant, and tourism sub-sector listed on the Indonesian 
stock exchange between 2016 and 2021.
Method: With data from the Indonesian stock exchange from 2016 
to 2021, comparative descriptive approaches and quantitative 
methodologies were employed in this study. Purposive sampling 
was used to sample, and it revealed 15 businesses that fit the bill.
Results: The findings in 15 companies show that profitability has no 
effect on firm value, with a significance value of 0,584; leverage has 
no effect on firm value, with a significance value of 0,896; capital 
structure has no effect on firm value, with a significance value of 
0,122; dividend policy is able to moderate profitability on firm 
value, with a significance value of 0,025; dividend policy is unable 
to moderate the effect of leverage; and capital structure has no effect 
on firm value.
Limitations: This study only uses the variables of profitability, 
leverage, capital structure, dividend policy to explain the variable 
value of the company, with a sample of companies in the hotel, 
restaurant and tourism sub-sector listed on the Indonesian stock 
exchange during 2016-2021.
Contribution: The results of this study will likely be applied in 
investment decision-making. Businesses with concerns about 
profitability, debt, and capital structure can also utilize this 
research's findings as knowledge so they can act right away to keep 
their operations going in the future.","HG, HJ",Goodwood Akuntansi dan Auditing Reviu,2022-11-01,

Therefore, rural development policies should consider these features to take full advantage of the benefits of rural development. This study aims to develop a pastoral assessment based on the TOPSIS-Etropy-Inhomogeneity Method. This research was conducted in Lampung Province using data at the regency level. The data uses village data from the 2018 Village Potential Survey (PODES). The results show that rural areas' exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity factors play an essential role in rural development regarding vulnerability and resilience. Pesisir Barat, Mesuji, and Tulang Bawang Regencies are highly susceptible to low adaptation factors such as difficult access to health centers, inadequate credit facilities from the government, quiet village anticipation and mitigation, and a lack of security systems. The lowest vulnerabilities are in Tanggamus and North Lampung Regencies with common sensitivity factors, where people with malnutrition, persons with disabilities, households living in slums, and the habit of not using river water or the like for drinking or cooking have lower scores. In addition, other factors contribute to vulnerability, and these factors should be considered in rural development policies.","HB, HC, HJ",Jurnal Perspektif Pembiayaan dan Pembangunan Daerah,2022-08-31,
"FEB5, FEB6","Future Natural Gas Price Forecasting Model and Its Policy
Implication","Future natural gas (FNG) price is a collected data over the years and is a volatile movement in the market. In other words, FNG price is categorised as a time series data with volatility in both variance and mean, as well as most likely in some cases having heteroscedasticity problem. To come up with an estimated prediction model, some analysis tools, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH), are introduced to find the best-fitted model having the smallest error value with high significance of probability value. This study aims to examine the best-fitted model that allows us to forecast FNG prices more accurately in the near future. There are 2842 observed
data of daily FNG prices from 2009 to 2019 as the input of study objects. The finding suggests that the first measurement model of ARIMA (1,1,1) does not fit the model as having a non-significant probability value. Thus, it is required to check its heteroscedasticity by conducting an ARCH effect test. It is concluded that a data set has an effect of ARCH, so AR (p)–GARCH (p,q) model is then tested. AR (1)–GARCH (1,1) model is believed to be a best-fitted model having a significant P < 0.0001 with significantly small mean squared error and root mean squared error values, indicating that it has a very accurate prediction model. The forecasting model is to adjust the offered recommendation of policy for the government regarding the issue of high volatility of daily FNG prices in the future. We then offer a best-suited policy for some certain governments like Indonesia to give subsidy for targeted users in order to keep increasing their use of FNG that will expectedly affect their marketable product innovation and expansion, so economic growth in Indonesia is maintained.","HB, HG, HJ",International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,2020,

,ANALISIS PENGARUH KEBIJAKAN DIVIDEN TERHADAP ABNORMAL RETURN SAHAM SEBELUM DAN SESUDAH EX DIVIDEND DATE DI BURSA EFEK INDONESIA TAHUN 2019-2021,"Pengumuman dividen merupakan informasi yang mengandung nilai ekonomis dan dapat menarik minat beli dari pelaku pasar sehingga harga akan meningkat. Sedangkan ex dividend date adalah hari tanpa dividen atau investor tidak lagi berhak menerima dividen sehingga dapat menyebabkan harga saham turun. Penelitian sebelumnya menemukan bahwa terdapat abnormal return yang positif sebelum tanggal ex dividen dan akan menurun setelah tanggal ex dividen. Namun fenomena kenaikan harga saham sebelum ex dividend date dan penurunan harga saham setelah ex dividend date masih menjadi perdebatan para peneliti. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memberikan bukti empiris tentang perbedaan rata-rata abnormal return saham big caps, medium caps dan small caps sebelum dan sesudah ex dividend date di Bursa Efek Indonesia periode 2019-2021. Sampel penelitian terdiri dari 94 perusahaan dengan kriteria sampel membagikan dividen selama tiga tahun berturut-turut. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kebijakan dividen berpengaruh terhadap abnormal return saham. Rata-rata, harga saham untuk semua kapitalisasi cenderung meningkat sebelum tanggal ex-dividend dan menurun setelah tanggal ex-dividend. Penelitian ini juga menemukan bahwa ukuran perusahaan berkorelasi negatif dengan rata-rata return saham. Artinya saham dengan ukuran kecil akan menghasilkan rata-rata return yang lebih tinggi dibandingkan saham perusahaan besar.","HG, HJ",GEMA EKONOMI (Jurnal Fakultas Ekonomi) Fakultas Ekonomi Universitas Gresik,2022,
