FISIP7,Pemikiran Ekologis Friedrich Engels: Tawaran menuju Ekologi Manusia Marxian,Sejak dua dasawarsa terakhir anggapan bahwa Marxisme yang 'Promethean' telah dipatahkan oleh serangkaian pembacaan baru yang mengemukakan pentingnya dimensi ekologis dalam pemikiran Marx dan Engels. Urgensi ini diartikulasikan dalam konsepsi metabolisme yang Marx gunakan untuk memahami relasi manusia dan alam. Perhatian atas dimensi ekologis serta ilmu pengetahuan alam juga kentara dalam karya‐karya Friedrich Engels. Esai ini ditujukan untuk memperkenalkan pemikiran ekologi Friedrich Engels. Pandangan Engels tentang ekologi sesungguhnya memiliki relevansi yang kuat dengan perkembangan pemikiran dalam bidang kajian antropologi lingkungan atau ekologi manusia.,"B1, HX",,2020,

FP1,Community Diversion Behavior in Pringsewu District,"This type of research uses qualitative phenomenology. The 
term phenomenology has been used so widely that there are 
different interpretations among experts. According to 
Polkinghorne (Creswell 1998), phenomenological studies 
describe the meaning of a life experience for some people 
about a concept or phenomenon. People who are involved in 
dealing with a phenomenon explore the structure of awareness 
of human life experience. The focus of phenomenological 
research is on essence (essence or basic things), invariant 
structure (structures that remain essential of live experience 
(things that are important from life experience) a group of 
people (community).",B1,International Journal of Research and Innovation in Social Science (IJRISS),2020-09,

learning modules that have nationality character values. The 
research aims to produce IPS multicultural based teaching 
material products and to analyze the effectiveness of the use of 
multicultural based IPS teaching materials. This research is a 
development research (R&D) of Borg and Gall. The module 
products are validated by learning material experts, learning 
media or design experts, linguists, social studies teachers and 
students. The effectiveness of the product is obtained by using a 
pre-test and post-test (control group design) experimental test. 
The pre test and post test results of IPS tests were analyzed using 
t test and normalized gain comparison. Based on the results of 
data analysis and discussion, the following conclusions are 
obtained: 1) Learning that uses multicultural-based teaching 
materials in social studies subjects as learning resources in social 
studies learning can improve student character values. 2)

FP1,"Preservation of Meaning and Value of Local Wisdom
Traditional House of Lampung Kepaksian Pernong
West Lampung","Qualitative research according to Bodgan and Taylor (1992) 
in Sujarweni (2014: 19) is a research procedure that produces 
descriptive data in the form of speech or writing and the 
behavior of the people being observed.
This approach strategy was chosen on the basis of the 
consideration that (1) a qualitative approach, even though it 
only covers a small / limited scale of the research location, is 
able to develop a broader conceptual framework, (2) this 
approach model is not only concerned with results, but also 
aspects of the process is something more important, even (3) 
this ethnographic qualitative approach is very good if a study 
wants to explain a phenomenon in depth and thoroughly so 
that the results of the research are detailed descriptions that 
are not rigid but also in-depth (Bogdan & Tylor, 1982: 35-
37).
Further considerations regarding this research approach are 
based on the diversity of carvings and spatial layouts in the 
Pernong testimonials, compared to the other four testimonies, 
so that the focus of this research is based on the meaning of 
spatial values and the value of carvings at the Pernong Palace. TThe data collection technique used to obtain data in the 
study was triangulation, which is a data collection technique 
that combines various data collection techniques and existing 
data sources. Researchers used different data collection 
techniques to obtain data from the same source. Researchers 
used observation, in-depth interviews and documentation.","B1, BL",International Journal of Research and Innovation in Social Science (IJRISS),2020-09,
