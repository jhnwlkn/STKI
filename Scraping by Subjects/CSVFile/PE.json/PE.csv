FKIP1,Exploring motivational orientations of English as foreign language (EFL) learners: A case study in Indonesia,"Motivation, which refers to students’ reasons for acting, has been well explored in language learning. However, studies on motivation in language learning in many countries have been predominantly inspired by theories of motivation in learning English developed in western countries. The current study serves to: i) identify the motivational orientations of EFL university students in Indonesia; and ii) to investigate whether the west-inspired theories of motivation are still relevant to the Indonesian EFL students. The subjects of the current study were 886 university students. With alphas .70, .53, and .77 for three motivational orientations, the data were then analysed by running Exploratory Factor Analysis with the varimax rotation. The results showed the existence of three reasonable motivational orientations of the EFL students in Indonesia and they are labelled as extrinsic, international and intrinsic orientation.","L1, PE",South African Journal of Education,2019-02-01,

FKIP1,The Effectiveness of Explicit-Implicit Vocabulary Learning Using Subtitled-Video on Vocabulary Mastery of Students of MTs. Darul A’mal,"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengamati efektifitas pembelajaran kosakata dengan pendekatan eksplisit-implisit menggunakan video yang diberikan subtitle L1 (Bahasa Indonesia) atau L2 (Bahasa Inggris) terhadap penguasaan 30 kosakata target. Desain penelitian ini adalah quasi-experimental dengan 2x2 desain faktorial. Tiga puluh (30) siswa di setiap kelas dimasukan kedalam salah satu dari empat perlakuan berikut; eksplisit-L1, explisit-L2, implisit-L1, dan implisit-L2. ANOVA dua jalur menunjukan adanya interaksi yang signifikan antara pembelajaran explisit-implisit dengan jenis subtitle yang digunakan dalam video terhadap hasil immediate post-test (p = 0.004 < α = 0.05). Pembelajaran kosakata dengan pendekatan explisit terbukti lebih unggul dibandingkan dengan pembelajaran implisit; dan video dengan subtitle berbahasa Indonesia (L1) terbukti lebih unggul dibanding video dengan subtitle berbahasa Inggris (L2). Hasil ini menunjukan bahwa video yang diberikan subtitle berbahasa Indonesia (L1) dapat menjadi sarana pembelajaran kosakata yang baik terutama ketika dibarengi dengan penggunaan pendekatan eksplisit.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of explicit and implicit vocabulary learning using video with L1 or L2 subtitle to students’ vocabulary mastery of 30 target words. The design is quasi-experimental with 2x2 factorial designs. Thirty (30) students in each classroom were assigned to one of these four conditions; explicit-L1 subtitle, explicit-L2 subtitle; implicit-L1 subtitle, and implicit-L2 subtitle. Two-way factorial ANOVA reveals that there is a statistically significant interaction between explicit-implicit learning and types of subtitled video on the students’ immediate post-test results (p = 0.004 < α = 0.05). Explicit learning was proved to be superior to implicit learning, and L1 subtitle is superior to L2 subtitle in four learning conditions. This result suggests that L1 (Indonesian) subtitled-authentic-video has proved to be a valuable resource to learn new vocabularies in the classroom, especially when presented using explicit instructions.

FKIP1,Modifying PPP in Promoting Communicative Language Teaching to Improve the Students’ English Communicative Competence (Similarity Check),"This study was going to find out the significant difference of the English communicative competence between the students who were taught by using original PPP method and the students who were taught by using modified PPP by using CLT. Moreover, the more effective method between original PPP method and the modified one in improving the students’ communicative competence was investigated. This is a quasi-experimental research using both control and experimental class comparing the original and modified PPP. The subject was forty junior EFL students whose English were still at the lower level. The result showed that there is a significant difference between students’ English communicative competence after being taught by using original PPP method and the modified one. In addition, both original and modified PPP are good to facilitate the learners in having good grammatical competence; however, only PPP that has been modified by using CLT that can facilitate them in having a good communicative competence.",PE,,2022-10-29,
FKIP1,THE EFFECT OF BLENDED LEARNING ACTIVITY IN IMPROVING THE STUDENTS' ENGLISH SPEAKING SKILL IN THE CONTEXT OF ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE,"This study is an attempt to elucidate the problem of msny Indonesian students who get failure in speaking English fluently and accurately. On behalf of that reason, this research is done to investigate the patterns of the students' discourse in blended learning activity of the advanced EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners. The analysis of the students' discourse showed that the online classroom activity gives more benefits for the students in performing their English speaking skills. Furthermore, the students predominantly tend to avoid speaking because they get nervous of which it leads some of them to produce code-mixing in their verbal performances. Thus, it suggests that blended learning activity gives the students a greater chance to improve their speaking skills so that the frequency of code-mixing can be diminished.","PE, PL",,2018-12,
FKIP1,A Modified Student Teams Achievement Divisions (MSTAD) to Enhance Students’ Vocabulary Achievement,"The research was implemented to find out i) the significant difference in vocabulary achievement between students who are taught with the STAD technique and the MSTAD technique and ii) to investigate the students’ perceptions towards MSTAD technique. This study applied the true experimental design. There were 32 experimental students and 30 control students as the sample chosen randomly at SMAN 3 Bandar Lampung. The instruments used were the vocabulary test, questionnaire and interview. The result showed that there was a statistically significant difference in vocabulary achievement between students who were taught with the STAD technique and MSTAD technique. It indicates that the vocabulary teaching technique is one of the factors which affects the students’ vocabulary achievement. Furthermore, the use of MSTAD technique in teaching vocabulary is regarded as being more effective to enhance the students’ vocabulary achievement.

and Implicit Instruction","This  study investigated whether  there  is a  statistically  significant difference  between  the  effect  of  explicit  instruction  and  implicit instruction on the students’ mastery in the simple past tense. The researcher  also tried 
to  find  out  the  constraints  of  teaching  and  learning  the  simple  past  tense through  explicit  and  implicit  instruction. Sixty  students from  two  classes in the  second  grade  of SMPN  6  Metro participated  in  this study. This  study is quantitative and qualitative research. 
The result showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the effect of explicit instruction and  implicit  instruction  on  the  students’ mastery in the simple past tense (p=0.006  <  0.05). 
The  constraints were revealed  such  as,  being  difficult to understand  the  questions  or material,  not  knowing  the  meaning  of  the language,  changing  the  present  to  the  past  form,  etc.  The  researchers suggest that explicit instruction is needed to improve the students’ grammar ability.

FKIP1,EFL Students' Needs of Digital Literacy to Meet the Demands of 21st Century Skills,"This study was a survey study which was aimed at looking at EFL students’ current knowledge and skills of ICT. The research questions of this study were(1) What levels of digital literacy are the EFL students?, (2) What are the factors affecting EFL students in using ICT in language learning?, and (3) What are the students' needs to improve their digital literacy skills to meet the demands of the 21st century skills?  Two groups of EFL students from two state-owned universities in the southern part of Sumatra were involved in this study. A set of questionnaires adapted from Ravitz (2014) was used. The findings showed that EFL students’ current level of digital literacy was categorized low. Factors affecting them from using ICT in language learning properly were limited use of ICT applications as a tool for language learning and limited access to computers and internet applications on campus. What the EFL students needed to improve their digital literacy skills was the availability of computers with internet applications to be used anytime on campus, ICT training for both teachers and students, and continuous integration of ICT in language learning.

LAMPUNG TOURISM BROCHURES","In translating, a translator can use some methods as s as suggested by Newmark (1988), namely: (1)
Word-for-word translation, (2) Literal translation, (3) Faithfull translation, and (4) Semantic
translation. In choosing this method, a translator neeeds to consider the construction and the culture of
the source language so that the result of the translation can be accepted well. The objectives of this
research are ; 1) to find out the methods used by the translators, and 2) to analyze whether the the
result of the translation is already equivalence to the source of the language. The brochures provided
by Toursim office of Lampung province were the data of this study. The results show that the
translators used only 3 (three) out of the 4 (four) methods, namely; 1) Word-for-word translation, 2)
Literal translation, 3) Faithfull translation. Among the three mehods,  Literal  translation method  is
the highest while the other two are approximately the same.  In general, the result of the translators
have the sameness meaning or equivalence . Only a few sentences are not equivalence to the source
language and not accepted in the target language. Based on the result it is suggested that  the
translators need  to re-read or to ask the proof readers before printing the result of the translation.

FKIP1,"The Contribution of Negotiation of
Meaning to Language Accuracy in an EFL
Setting through a Focused Task","Abstract
Despite the extensive research on the negotiation of meaning (NoM) using
unfocused tasks, to our knowledge no study portrays to what extent NoM
contributes to learners’ language accuracy, grammar, and vocabulary, in
particular, using a focused task. Therefore, this research set out to obtain
in-depth information about the contribution of NoM to language accuracy
when learners were assigned to engage in a focused task discussion. The
participants, treated as three dyads based on their English proficiency,
were taken purposely from one class of the sixth-semester students in the
Department of English Education in the Faculty of Education at
Universitas Lampung, Indonesia. They were paired based on their English
abilities (high-high; high-low; low-low) and their intimates among the 24
students in the class. All their utterances produced during a fifteen-minute
focused task discussion were recorded and analyzed following the theory
of NoM and language accuracy. It was discovered that the learners were
engaged in NoM during the focused task discussion, and it contributes to
the students’ language accuracy. Therefore, to optimize the contribution
of NoM to language accuracy, the topic to be discussed should be based
on the learners’ output (focused task) since the interlocutor can offer
assistance as part of the negotiation of meaning process. The suggestions
for future research are also discussed.

Background: The objectives of the research were to investigate whether there was a statistically significant
difference of the students’ reading comprehension achievement after the implementation of RAP strategy and
also how students’ perception is toward the application of RAP strategy.
Materials and Methods: The approach used in this research was quantitative. The subjects were 23 students of
second grade majoring in business and marketing at SMKN 9 Bandar Lampung. The reading tests and
questionnaire were used as the research instrument. Furthermore, the data were analyzed by using Repeated
Measure t-test and the questionnaire was scored according to Likert scale.
Results: The resulst showed that there was a statically significant difference of students’ reading
comprehension with the significant level 0.05. In the pre-test, the mean score was 64.65. After giving the
treatments, the mean score of the post-test was 80.74. Thus, the students’ mean score of the pre-test and the
post-test was improved 16.09 points. Moreover, it was found that students have positive perceptions towards the
application of RAP strategy.
Conclusion: From the results, it is suggested that RAP strategy can facilitate students to improve their
achievement in reading comprehension. In addition, students have positive perceptions toward the application
of RAP strategy.

corrective feedback and negotiation of meaning. In enhancing students’ written language accuracy, indirect
corrective feedback in the form of codes, and peer direct corrective feedback in the form of explanation were applied
to 24 students of English Education Faculty (FKIP) of the University of Lampung who took Pre-intermediate
writing class. The design was descriptive quantitative. The results demonstrate that ; (1) language accruracy on
grammar is considered low but not on vocabulary and spelling, 2) indirect corrective feedback works well only if
the students’ have prior linguistic ability, 3) direct corrective feedback works well because peer (s) did negotiation
of meaning in forms of clarification , and 4) students have various response during the corrective feedback. The
finding was discussed on the basis of relevant theories.

 The result of the study shows that the kinship
system was created based on blood, marga (family
name) and the relationship in the society. The terms
of address of Batak Toba-Samosir were used by
Batak people when they speak among themselves
using Batak language or Indonesian. Sometimes they
also use the terms of address when they speak to
other ethnics. Semantically, some of the terms of
address can be analyzed but some do not. In short,
they create them arbitrary. Besides, other ethnics
sometimes use the terms of address inappropriately

respectively took 22 of the total frequency. The frequencies of PCF
varied, explicitly or implicitly, (2) PCF significantly increased the
learners’ writing quality. Nevertheless, it is notable that after the
empirical data were analyzed in depth, it was found out that not all

The objectives of this study are :1) to describe linguistics problems produced by the students
during the negotiation of meaning in pair work discussion, and 2) to describe the students’
language awareness (willingness and unwillingness to correct the linguistics problems). This study
applied descriptive quantitative design and the subjects are 3 pairs consisting of high-high (H-H)
learner, high and low (H-L) learner and low- low (L-L) learner. All of them are the fourth semester
students of English department of teachers training faculty of Lampung University in academic
2018/2019. Each pair was given a topic (chosing 5 personality traits that a teacher should have). Each
pair discussed the topic and during the discussion, all their utterances were recorded, transcribed and
were analyzed based on relevant theories. The results show that each pair produced linguistics
problems, such as grammatical and vocabulary. Most of the learners, especially H-L and L-L are not
aware of linguistics problems because they focus more on the message across. Eventhough some
of the pairs are aware of linguistics problems and are willing to correct them, it does not gurantee
that the input can be internalized by their pairs since they focus more on meaning during the
interaction. Therefore, it is suggested further researchers investigate this phenomena.

FKIP1,"The Contribution of Negotiation of
Meaning to Language Accuracy in an EFL
Setting through a Focused Task","Abstract
Despite the extensive research on the negotiation of meaning (NoM) using
unfocused tasks, to our knowledge no study portrays to what extent NoM
contributes to learners’ language accuracy, grammar, and vocabulary, in
particular, using a focused task. Therefore, this research set out to obtain
in-depth information about the contribution of NoM to language accuracy
when learners were assigned to engage in a focused task discussion. The
participants, treated as three dyads based on their English proficiency,
were taken purposely from one class of the sixth-semester students in the
Department of English Education in the Faculty of Education at
Universitas Lampung, Indonesia. They were paired based on their English
abilities (high-high; high-low; low-low) and their intimates among the 24
students in the class. All their utterances produced during a fifteen-minute
focused task discussion were recorded and analyzed following the theory
of NoM and language accuracy. It was discovered that the learners were
engaged in NoM during the focused task discussion, and it contributes to
the students’ language accuracy. Therefore, to optimize the contribution
of NoM to language accuracy, the topic to be discussed should be based
on the learners’ output (focused task) since the interlocutor can offer
assistance as part of the negotiation of meaning process. The suggestions
for future research are also discussed.

The main objective of this study is   to explore how students of the EnglishEducation Study  Program  at  the  Faculty  of  Education  of  the  University  of  Lampung,  Indonesia perceivelearning,involving an unfocused taskand focused task.The participants of this study weregrouped in 3pairs; high-high(H-H), high-low(H-L)and low-low(L-L)pairs.In  the  unfocused  task,  each  pair  was  given  a  topic.  They  selected  5  from  24  available personality traits with a reason for each. While in the focused task, the discussed topics were   the   linguistic   problems   (grammar   and   vocabulary)   coming   up   during   the unfocused   task.An   adapted   open-ended   interview method aimed   at   measuring perceptions  of  unfocused  and  focused  tasks  served  as  the research instrument.  The results revealed several facts about the twotasks including that the unfocused task was enjoyable to all the three types of pairs, but they failedto get input for the good of the development of their language qualitybecause during the negotiation of meaning they focused  more  on  meaning.  Secondly,  the focusedtask was enjoyable  to  H-H  and  H-Lpairs  for  different  reasons,  and  too  difficult  and  stressful for  the L-L  pair.In  other words,  focusedtask was not appropriate  for  L-L pair. It  is  recommended  that further studies involving more categories should investigate this field further.

FKIP1,The effect of using WhatsApp in an online learning setting on Indonesian EFL students’ writing apprehension and the relation with their writing achievement,"The primary goals of this research are to investigate the students’ writing apprehension level after being taught through WhatsApp in an online learning setting and to find out the correlation between writing apprehension and writing achievement. This study was carried out quantitatively and involved one class of grade X which consisted of thirty-five students. The data was collected through the English Writing Test and Writing Apprehension Test, a questionnaire that was developed by Daly and Miller (1975). To test the hypotheses, paired sample t-test and Pearson correlation analysis were applied. The finding of the paired sample t-test revealed that there was a significant reduction in the students’ writing apprehension level after the implementation of WhatsApp in online writing classes. Meanwhile, the correlational analysis was done three times to obtain more specific results; the correlation of the data before the treatment, the correlation of the data after the treatment, and the correlation of gain scores of the data. The results showed respectively that two correlational analyses had a very high correlation and the last one had an average correlation. Furthermore, all findings showed a significant negative correlation; meaning that there was a significant inverse relationship between writing apprehension and writing achievement. This implied that the lower the level of writing apprehension is, the higher the score of writing achievement would be. In conclusion, the implementation of WhatsApp in the online writing class is effective to improve students' writing achievement and effective to reduce students’ writing apprehension in Indonesian EFL students.","LB, PE",U-Jet: Unila Journal of English Teaching,2020-09,

learners in Indonesia. Thus, this study was specifically aimed at investigating EFL learners’ most frequently-performed EFL learning activities through smartphones, the predominant
online language use, and the relationship between EFL learners’ predominant online language use and their perceived EFL proficiency. The study adopted a quantitative approach. The findings reveal that the participants still more frequently access content and
information from their smartphones for receptive rather than interactive/productive online
activities. Indonesian, which is the participants’ first language, is still predominantly used for their online activities. The mean score of the perceived EFL proficiency of those who frequently perform online activities in English is statistically and significantly higher than those performing online activities in Indonesian. Overall, the mean score of the perceived EFL proficiency of those performing online activities in English is higher than those in Indonesian, although the difference is not statistically significant.

The population was the students of SMKN 1 Metro. This study is quasi-experimental, and the sampling
was taken in two classes. The experimental class was given the treatment using a modified PPP procedure through WhatsApp. In contrast, the control class was given the treatment using the original PPP procedure in limited offline learning. The findings showed a significant difference in students' achievement of conditional sentences between those two procedures, which is in line with the difference in students' perception of the learning process between those two classes. Modified one was more effective in improving students' achievement of conditional sentences, especially in pandemic Covid 19, where online learning is necessary. The conclusion is that the modification of the PPP procedure through WhatsApp is very effective to use even after the pandemic, because there are more opportunities for students to discuss using WhatsApp which makes them gain a deeper understanding and better achievement of the conditional sentence material.",PE,,2022-10-29,

The teaching and learning activities were based on academic texts selected by the students in a group of ten. In every meeting a group of the students who had prepared a two-page English academic text presented its title and key words to the class, whereas the other groups asked questions based on the title and key words which had to be answered by the group orally. In every meeting at the end of the class the students were asked to write a journal according to the research questions. The results showed that they perceived the teaching and learning practice differently, they had some problems, but they learnt some linguistic elements and skills, and they realized that they still needed to improve their English skill as well as their participation in speaking.

FKIP1,The Indonesian EFL Learners’ Perceptions of Task Complexity,"With reference to the Cognition Hypothesis, pedagogical tasks should be designed on the basis of task complexity (cognitive factors). Task-based studies have been predominantly concerned with the effect of manipulating task complexity on learners’ language performance in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF).Very few studies have investigated learners’ affective factors with respect to the implementation of task complexity. This study aimed at exploring learners’ in-depth perceptions of four types of task complexity. The subjects of the current study were 90 students of English Department, Lampung University, Indonesia. Interview was used to collect the learners’ perceptions.The findings of the current study indicate that aspects other than task complexity (cognitive factors) are also required as bases for designing pedagogical tasks in language teaching. The results of this study inform researchers, EFL teachers, and syllabus designers a framework for holistic task design.

The objectives of this article are to find out 1) the language/s used by the senior high school students to realize their refusals in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classes and 2) the refusal strategies used to refuse their teachers’ directives. To reach the objectives, audio-recording ofthe English teaching learning process in a natural setting accompanied by observation was done in 37 classes at different senior high schools in Lampung Province. The recording took 2 x 90 minutes in each of the classes. The recordings were then transcribed into a written form and the
refusals performed by the students as well as their contexts were identified.The identified refusals, whether they were expressed in English, Indonesian or local language, were classified by kinds of language,and refusal strategies by using Beebe, Takahashi, & Uliss-Weltz’s classification in Wijayanto (2013).The results showed that the students produced refusals in Indonesian and English to their teachers’ directives. The refusal strategies employed by the
students found in this study were‘no directly’, ‘excuse, reason, explanation for not complying’,‘statement of an alternative’, ‘promise of future action’, ‘avoidance by keeping silent’, and ‘avoidance by laughing’.

FKIP1,BILINGUALS’ LINGUISTIC REPERTOIRE AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION: WHAT DO TEACHERS SAY ABOUT TEACHING EFL THROUGH TRANSLANGUAGING?,"In recent decades, translanguaging has made rapid progress in the field of language instruction. The term ""translanguaging"" implies that bilinguals have a single linguistic repertoire from which they strategically select linguistic features for effective communication. The current method of language education, which takes a monolingual approach, faces a challenge from the phenomenon known as translanguaging. Therefore, this study aims to describe the perspectives of Indonesian EFL teachers on translanguaging-based EFL instruction for students from a variety of linguistic backgrounds. This is a qualitative study employing interviews to collect data, with eight EFL teachers serving as participants. A content analysis was used to analyze the collected data. This study suggests that EFL teachers have divergent perspectives on translanguaging in EFL classrooms. However, those with negative attitudes toward translanguaging recognize the importance of this pedagogical approach and continue to use L1 in their EFL classrooms, indicating that they still believe in monolingual pedagogy even though they do not fully apply it. Finally, the study's implications and limitations are discussed.","PE, PL",Journal of Language,2022-05-30,

With the Cronbach’s alpha of the measurement at .92 and the alphas of the skill–based strategies at .78, .75, .79 and .77 for strategies for listening, speaking, reading and writing respectively, the criteria on reliability of internal consistency for the 80 items of the measurement were very high so that the strategies were justified to be grouped into a scale. The empirical data in this study shows that different language skills were significantly correlated with the use of different learning strategies. The skill-based categories of language learning strategies introduced in this study, which cover cognitive, metacognitive and social strategies in each category, can be used to portray learners’ use of language learning strategies when learners learn the four language skills of English as a foreign language in Indonesian context. The findings suggest that language teachers need to condition the process of teaching and learning in order for their students to use effective learning strategies according to the language skills that leaners are learning.",PE,English Language Teaching,2016-06-02,

FKIP1,Teaching Procedure Text Using Islamic Tutorial Video,"English  language  general  subject usually is  considered  by  the  students  at  Islamic  university  of Lampung as the unattractive and boring subject since it is not very much related to their major. Lecturers in the millennial era must seek a way to make this general subject into a fun way and at the same time must engage this subject to the Islamic major. Then, lecturer needs a media which can support the teaching English language general subject in fun and purposeful ways. One of the examples  of  using  media  in English  language  general  subject  is  teaching  procedure  text  using tutorial  video.  In  this  paper,  this  study  is  aimed  to  discuss  some  related  literatures  about  the implementation of tutorial video in teaching procedure text as beneficial tools. The discussion of those literatures is also supported by the researcher’s experience in teaching procedure text using Islamic tutorial video in English language general subject class in Islamic university of Lampung. After the learning process was done, it is found that the English language subject can be engaged in Islamic practice in fun and attractive ways. Students also can make their own procedure text in the form of tutorial video which is related to the practice of Islam. This paper ends its conclusion by recommending the English language general subject lecturer to use Islamic tutorial video to teach procedure text but they must selectively give to the students.

FKIP1,The effect of using pronunciation applications on students' pronunciation abilities,"ABSTRACT
 
As part of speaking skill, pronunciation has an important factor in learning English as a
foreign language, especially in communication. In English communication, if our
pronunciation is wrong or inappropriate the result will be miscommunication, even to the
point of not conveying the purpose of communication in a conversation because the
meaning of a word or sentence is not conveyed properly. So far, the steps for learning and
modeling pronunciation in English are done directly or face-to-face. Lecturers and
students also need appropriate learning media and support online learning to carry out this
Pronunciation course. Regarding applications, the benefits of many applications that are
suitable for learning English are; students can watch videos related to the topic, are able
to save examples of learning materials, and are able to save the exercises they have done
as learning evaluation material for teachers and students later. Applications which are
appropriate are the methods which are not only support online learning but can also
improve students' pronunciation skills. This study aims to determine whether or not using
the pronunciation application have an significant effect on students' pronunciation
abilities. This study is used one group pretest-posttest. This design analyzes the results of
students' pronunciation abilities at the beginning and at the end of the lesson. The subjects
of this study were undergraduate students of the English Education Study Program, FKIP
University of Lampung. One class consists of 31 students who take pronunciation
courses. Based on the data analysis, the researcher concludes that there is no significant
difference of students’ pronunciation ability before and after taught using pronunciation
applications. Meanwhile, we can say that there is slightly significant improvement
between pretest of posttest of pronunciation test.

This study was intended to identify the influence of YouTube videos to students listening ability. Moreover, it was expected that using YouTube as a listening media, may improve students’ listening ability, and make listening subject more engaging. Pre-experimental quantitative, with one group pre-test post-test, was applied in this study. This research design analyzed students’ listening ability at the initial, and final part of the lessons. The subjects of this study were undergraduate students of English Department, University of Lampung. There were 23 samples taken from pre intermediate listening class.From the result of the data analysis show that the students’ average score in the pre test is 76.65 and the mean score of the post test is 82.04, so that the gained score is 5.39. After the calculationof Paired sample t-test used, it showed the result of the two tailed significance was 0.000. It indicates that the influence is significant since 0.000 is less than 0.05 (0.00 < 0.05). It means that Null hypothesis (H0) is rejected, while Alternative hypothesis (H1) is accepted,. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is significant influence of using Youtube videos toward students’ listening comprehension. Regarding students’ perception of listening class with YouTube videos, a survey via Google form had been distributed to all 23 students. All of the students were asked to fill in the form after the lessons were completed. The result showed that all students agreed that using YouTube videos made listening class more engaging. Further, 90% of the samples believed that YouTube videos helped them to comprehend better when listening to English conversation, and 87% believed that YouTube videos gave contextual examples that could relate to real life situation.

The present study reports on the implementation of an implicit strategy training for metacognitive strategies in the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) setting in Indonesia. In the study which involved 37 senior high school students, strategies were measured using a questionnaire based on a seven - point Likert scale comprising of metacognitive strategies for the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. To find out the effect of implicit learning strategy training on students’ learning strategy use, a paired sample t-test was used to compare the data taken from the students’ learning strategy questionnaire. An English proficiency test was also administered for the purpose of the identification of the students’ proficiency in English before and after the treatment, and to correlate them with the use of metacognitive strategies. The findings indicate that there was a trend towards students using metacognitive strategies of the four language skills more frequently after they were trained to use such strategies implicitly. In particular, the study reveals that the language learners significantly improved their use of metacognitive strategies in writing, and the use of metacognitive strategies in writing was significantly correlated to students’ writing performance.

FKIP1,READING STRATEGIES USED BY EFL LEARNERS,"Reading strategies are the mental processes that readers consciously choose to use in accomplishing reading task (Cohen, 1998: 133). These strategies have some characteristics, i.e., planning, competition, conscious manipulation and movement toward a goal. Learning strategy, on the other hand, is any attempt used by a learner to make learning easier, faster, more enjoyable, more self-directed, more effective, and more transferable to new situations (Oxford, 1990: 8).
In the case of reading strategies, Brown (1980) asserts that we incorporate any deliberate planful control of activities that give birth to comprehension. These are called metacognitive activities and include (Brown, 1980: 456). The effective reader engages in a variety of deliberate tactics to ensure efficiency. 
Reading strategies can also indicate how readers conceive a task, what textual cues that attend to, how they make a sense of what they read, and what they do when they do not understand (Block, 1986, King, 2010), Therefore, strategies reveal a reader’s recourses for understanding (Langer, 1982).
	The efficient reader always tries to find the most effective strategies that can be used; the information is analyzed only to the depth necessary to meet current needs. According to Brown (1980), these activities involve metacognition, that is, conscious deliberate attempts to understand one’s efforts at being strategies.
According to this study the two most common strategies used by the students are pronouncing and skipping strategies, which were used 811 and 652 times respectively. The next order of strategies that were used most frequently by the students are regressing, syntax, guessing, dictionary, graphic, morphemic, intuitive and ignoring. Ignoring is the least strategy used by the students in the research.  There are many strategies used by learners in coping with words in a text. These strategies are usually for both developing vocabulary and dealing with unknown words in a text. Some experts suggest that even the strategies are common; it does not imply that they are all useful for all learners and should be taught to foreign language readers because some strategy investigations are coming from learners when they read. Some strategies are found to impede the readers’ process to determine meaning.","L1, PE",Seventh conference on English studies,2010-11-26,
FKIP1,VOCABULARY CONSTRAINTS ON READING MATERIALs,"Written English usually contains greater variety of lexical items than spoken conversational English. It is claimed that the condition of the words in a reading materials has a great influence on readers’ comprehension. This case study was carried out in Undergraduate Program of State University of Malang (UM). The aim of the study is to identify and describe the vocabulary in the reading materials and to seek if the text is useful for reading skill development. A descriptive qualitative design was applied to obtain the data. For this purpose, some available computer programs were used. They were used to find the description of vocabulary in the texts. It was found that the texts, containing 7,945 words of 20 different texts, are dominated by low frequency words which account for 16.97% of the words in the texts. In terms of high frequency words occurring in the texts, function words dominate the texts. In the case of word levels, it was found that the texts being used have very limited number of words from GSL (West, 1953). The proportion of the first 1,000 words of GSL only accounts for 44.6%. The data also show that the texts contain too large proportion of words which are not in the three levels (the first 2,000 and UWL). These words account for 26.44% of the running words in the texts.  It is believed that the constraints are due to the selection of the texts which are made of a series of short-unrelated texts (Stahl, K. and Bravo, 2010). This kind of text is subject to the accumulation of low frequency words especially those of content words and limited of words from GSL. It could also defeat the development of students’ reading skills and vocabulary enrichment.","LB2300, PE",Asian Journal of Science and Technology,2018-01,
