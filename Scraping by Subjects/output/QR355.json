      "abstract": "Wonosadi forest is managed forests by indigenous forest communities and is located in the hamlet of Duren and Sidorejo, Beji village, subdistrict Ngawen, Gunung Kidul regency, Yogyakarta. One of the biological richness contained in Wonosadi forest is very valuable natural orchids and need to be preserved. Management to the preservation of nature in the woods Wonosadi orchids can be done through natural orchid protection against infectious pathogens, including viruses. Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) is one type of orchid viruses infect most widely reported and has spread widely in the world, including in Indonesia. ORSV can cause severe damage to the orchid. Therefore, it is necessary to study to detect ORSV that infect wild orchids in the forest Wonosadi molecular basis for detecting the presence and pattern of infection ORSV as well as possible to reduce the severity of disease caused by infection with the virus. The purpose of this study is to assess the natural orchid ORSV infection in molecular Wonosadi forest that can be used as a database in an effort to protect against natural orchid Wonosadi forest. In the long term, the results of this study are very useful to support conservation efforts and determine appropriate conservation efforts for wild orchids in the forest Wonosadi. The initial phase of the study conducted a survey and collection of samples of wild orchids in the forest leaves that show symptoms of infection Wonosadi ORSV. Furthermore, molecular analysis performed with gene amplification Coat Protein ORSV using Reverse engineering Trancriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).",

      "abstract": "The Indonesian government has long supported educational institutions to provide clean and healthy living habits through the Ministry of Health. However, clean and healthy living habits in schools seem to be increasingly important nowadays, because in the new normal era of the corona virus pandemic, children will soon return to school. Schools must maintain a clean and healthy lifestyle by involving teachers, students, and the community in the school environment and following certain health-related procedures. The school environment also needs to be made clean and healthy. The benefit of maintaining a clean and healthy lifestyle at school is to create a clean and healthy environment. In this way, the teaching process will run smoothly, and the health of teachers, students and the surrounding community will not be disturbed. Education on clean and healthy living habits is packaged in a national seminar in collaboration with SMA Negeri 19 Surabaya on Sunday, March 28, 2021. This activity is carried out in the form of lectures with the help of power points, through a zoom meeting platform which is also broadcast live on Youtube. The material presented includes three things with the author himself as the resource person and moderator of the event. The three materials are about Covid-19 and its development, the Covid-19 vaccine and its effectiveness, and the application of clean and healthy living habits in an effort to fight Covid-19. As for the participants, students from SD, SMP, and SMA with a total of 78 people and general participants reaching 11 people. This service is carried out independently and is carried out well in accordance with the objectives expected by the executor.",

      "abstract": "Aim: The existence of Orchid Mycorrhizal Fungi (OMF) has a role to stimulate growth and support the\r\nsupply of orchid nutrition as a biofertilizer agent. This study aimed to determine the association of\r\nmycorrhizal with Phalaenopsis amabilis (L.) Blume which was carried out through the effectiveness\r\ntest of two Indonesian orchid mycorrhizal isolates i.e. Ceratorhiza and Trichoderma.\r\nStudy Design: This study consisted of 4 treatments. Each treatment was repeated 3 times, each\r\nrepetition of 5 plantlets, so that the total plantlet used was 60.\r\nPlace and Duration of Study: Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Department of Biology, Universitas\r\nGadjah Mada, Indonesia, between June 2017 and April 2018.\r\nMethodology: The method of inoculating orchid mycorrhizal by placing a plantlet in a petri\r\ndish containing orchid mycorrhizal for 1, 2, 3 and 4 days. Then plantlets are grown on sterile moss\r\ngrowing media and acclimatized in a greenhouse. Observation of each treatment is carried\r\nout every day for the next month. Observation variables include the number of initial\r\nand final roots, the number of live and dead roots, and the number of living and dead plants.\r\nResults: The results of the orchid mycorrhizal induction test showed that the Ceratorhiza\r\ninoculation treatment showed a fluctuation in the mean increase in the number of final roots,\r\nlive roots, dead roots, and dead plantlets that were higher than the Trichoderma inoculation treatment.\r\nThe results also showed that the best inoculation time on Ceratorhiza and Trichoderma was day 3\r\nand 4. The adaptation process had the effect of increasing the number of dead roots in weeks 1 and\r\n2. The adaptation process stopped at the beginning of week 4 with the number of new roots\r\nappearing a lot.\r\nConclusion: Orchid mycorrhizal Ceratorhiza shows the value of effectiveness test compared with\r\nTrichoderma. The results of this study are expected to be basic information in efforts to cultivate\r\nnatural orchids in Indonesia.",

      "abstract": "The botanical garden is an ex situ conservation area that is used as a center for the conservation of plant diversity\r\nfrom extinction. Natural orchid is one of the botanical garden collections and is a native flora of Indonesia which has an\r\nimportant role as a parent crossing. Disease infection is still one of the limiting factors in orchid conservation efforts.\r\nDetection of diseases against natural orchids in the Bogor Botanical Gardens, Purwodadi Botanical Gardens, and\r\nBalikpapan Botanical Gardens showed positive reactions infected with Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV). The\r\ncharacterization results are known that ORSV Indonesia is thought to originate from Germany. Based on the data it is\r\nknown that the spread of the virus occurs through the trade activities of orchid seedlings and cut flowers. This report is a\r\nbig consideration considering the role of the botanical garden as a conservation institution and the foremost fortress in\r\nsaving plants. The botanical garden is obliged to maintain and maintain every collection that is owned in order to grow\r\nwell. In addition, efforts to prevent the spread of diseases that have already entered must receive more attention through\r\nimproving the quality of research. This finding also shows that botanical gardens in Indonesia are not yet safe and free\r\nfrom disease. Efforts to maintain the collection plants by the botanical garden are still lacking. Detection should be carried\r\nout routinely to monitor the development and spread of the disease, and control measures as early as possible. Another\r\neffective way to protect and maintain the health status of natural orchids in Indonesia is to limit and control the importation\r\nof orchids from other countries.",
